Water Security Challenges of the Clean Energy Transition: Transitioning from fossil energy to renewables 
generally reduces water consumption and limits thermal and chemical pollution into aquatic ecosystems. 
Yet, mismanaged renewable sources like bioenergy and hydropower could exacerbate existing water-
related issues (ICSU, 2017) (SDG 6). Furthermore, growing water stress in dry regions poses a threat to 
the power sector regarding energy security, potentially reducing hydropower generation in regions with 
declining water flows such as southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Variability in 
hydropower production has worsened the global energy crisis. Reduced hydropower generation in Latin 
America during 2021 drove up the demand for liquefied natural gas, resulting in early pressure on natural 
gas prices. Similarly, the significant drop in hydropower output in southern Europe in 2022 compounded 
the strain on gas and electricity markets due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to cuts in pipeline gas 
deliveries (IEA, 2023).  
Balancing Land use for Renewable Energy and Food Security: Compared to conventional sources, 
renewables often demand more land, potentially conflicting with ecosystem protection (SDG 15) and food 
security (SDG 2). Scaling up bioenergy might clash with efforts to sustainably manage forests, halt 
deforestation, and protect biodiversity through practices like monocropping for energy crops and large-
scale solar installations. Developing agrofuels could elevate global food prices and compete for 
agricultural resources, impacting affordability and access to food for the vulnerable (ICSU, 2017). Large-
scale renewable projects, especially hydroelectric dams, significantly affect land use, disrupting local 
economies such as agriculture and fishing and aggravating food security (SDGs, 2022). Local land-use 
changes can scale up impacts at global scale, requiring international coordination and systemic 
approaches (ICSU, 2017). Multiple land uses and integrated solutions can reduce adverse impacts of 
renewable energy. Bioenergy’s unique aspect lies in its potential as a land 
management co-product, supporting ecological services like soil restoration, wildfire 
prevention, and habitat preservation (SDGs, 2022).  Adopting policies that prioritize 
 
Box 10: In Yemen, rural women led the establishment of the nation's first private solar energy grid 
under the Enhanced Rural Resilience in Yemen (ERRY) Joint Programme. Supported by the European 
Union (EU) and implemented by FAO, ILO, UNDP, and WFP across four Yemeni governorates, this 
initiative empowered ten female entrepreneurs through UNDP's 3x6 Approach. Over three years, the 
project aims to strengthen crisis-affected rural communities, focusing on sustainable livelihoods, food 
security, governance, social cohesion, and access to sustainable energy. UNDP collaborates with the 
Sustainable Development Foundation (SDF) in this endeavor. 
 
 
 
bioenergy crop growth on degraded lands can mitigate global agricultural market impacts while enhancing 
soil health and biodiversity (ICSU, 2017). Notably, the “Solar Pyramid”, project in Curitiba, Brazil, utilized 
landfills for solar power plants, supported by C40’s network, a coalition of mayors fighting climate change 
(Box 11). Emerging technologies like agrivoltaics serve as innovative integrated land-use systems, enabling 
simultaneous production of food, electricity, and water, (FAO, 2021) (EU Science Hub, 2023), as 
exemplified by the Indian case study (Box 12) 
 
 
Environmental Footprint of Green Energy Value Chain: Renewable energies' impact on water resources 
(SDG 14) and (SDG 15) land footprints extend across their entire value chain. The extraction of minerals 
necessary for manufacturing renewable components like solar, wind, and batteries, coupled with 
challenges in end-of-life recycling, significantly influences their environmental implications. Subterranean 
footprints from drilling boreholes or fracking can affect water aquifers and geological formations. 
Evaluating their environmental footprint mandates a comprehensive assessment of land impacts, 
considering the entire life cycle, from fuel extraction to decommissioning. Notably, a single energy 
technology can vary significantly in its land footprint. For example, solar panels made from cadmium have 
a smaller land footprint compared to silicon panels (Our World in Data, 2022). These environmental 
impacts, including mining materials and energy consumption during refining processes, underscore the 
critical role of deployment choices and technological considerations. 
Governance and Community Rights in Renewable Energy: The pursuit of critical energy transition 
materials drives attention toward sustainable socioeconomic growth. Renewable energy manufacturing 
Initiatives can bolster local manufacturing and create jobs, but can also contribute to environmental harm 
and exploitation of workers and communities (SDG 8). Efforts to secure these resources through export 
bans and industry nationalization align with national economic interests but require comprehensive 
approaches that uphold community rights, labor rights, and environmental 
sustainability (IRENA, 2023). Moreover, large-scale renewable energy projects, such 
as hydropower dams or bioenergy, can disrupt traditional land management, impact 
Box 11: The Solar Pyramid launched in 2023 in Curitiba is the Latin America's first solar plant on a 
former landfill, backed by C40's CFF. This landmark project demonstrates how cities can achieve clean, 
affordable energy while decreasing reliance on fossil fuels in their urban grids. The city primarily relies 
on hydroelectric power but faces energy shortages during droughts, resorting to fossil gas and coal 
plants. The Solar Pyramid supplies 8MW of energy capacity across Curitiba, slashing CO2 emissions by 
90,000 tonnes (2020-2050), akin to removing 20,000 cars yearly. Additionally, it generates 
US$500,000 annually by substituting grid electricity with solar production. 
Box 12: Agrivoltaics is rapidly expanding globally, and India is initiating its adoption with over a dozen 
pilot projects nationwide. A research led by the International Institute for Sustainable Development 
(IISD), evaluates the current development status, outlining challenges and opportunities for 
Agrivoltaics commercialization in India. The work aims to expedite adoption by offering policy 
recommendations, proposing business models, and providing a financial and technical transitions 
mechanism for state agencies, developers, and stakeholders.

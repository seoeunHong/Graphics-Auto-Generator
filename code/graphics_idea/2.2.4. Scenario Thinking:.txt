2.2.3. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis frameworks  
Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) is a decision-making framework that evaluates alternatives influenced by 
diverse, conflicting factors. It integrates different metrics, particularly helpful for non-monetary impacts, 
aiding evaluations amidst conflicting objectives. Through individual criteria, it provides overall 
performance indicators for alternatives, allowing comparative assessments. By ranking options based on 
established criteria, MCA guides project evaluation and decision-making phases, offering insights into 
trade-offs among alternatives. Its strengths lie in enabling non-monetary impact comparison and 
systematically evaluating conflicting factors to identify stable solutions in complex decision problems (WB, 
2023) (IAEA) 
 
2.2.4. Scenario Thinking:  
Scenario Thinking is a qualitative method visualizing plausible futures, providing narratives about potential 
developments in a specific region or issue. It's designed to explore diverse future possibilities amidst 
uncertainty and engages stakeholders in envisioning sustainable development pathways. This approach 
addresses complexity, encourages stakeholder collaboration, supports quantitative analysis, and creates 
compelling narratives about achieving sustainable development goals. Utilizing participatory exercises, it 
generates qualitative storylines, engages stakeholders, integrates sustainable 
development dimensions, and identifies short-/medium-/long-term effects of 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        The passage contains several data points that would benefit from graphical representation to enhance understanding. These include:

1. Processes considered through the Life Cycle perspective: Figure 9 mentioned in the passage could be included as an actual graphic to visually represent the different processes considered in the Life Cycle perspective. This could be a flowchart or a diagram showing the different stages or steps involved in the life cycle perspective.

2. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis frameworks: A graphic or infographic could be created to illustrate how Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) works. This could include a visual representation of the decision-making framework, showing how different metrics are integrated and how conflicting factors are evaluated. It could also show how MCA provides overall performance indicators and allows for comparative assessments.

3. Scenario Thinking: An infographic could be designed to explain the concept of Scenario Thinking. This could include visual representations of different scenarios or potential futures, along with narratives about potential developments. It could also show how Scenario Thinking addresses complexity, encourages stakeholder collaboration, and supports quantitative analysis.

In terms of design, the graphics or infographics should be visually appealing and easy to understand. They should use clear and concise labels or captions to explain the information being presented. Color could be used to differentiate between different processes or factors. The graphics should also be accompanied by a brief explanation or description to provide context and further enhance understanding.

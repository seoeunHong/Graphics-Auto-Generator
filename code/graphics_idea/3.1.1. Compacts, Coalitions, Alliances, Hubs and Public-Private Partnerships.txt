United Nations Global Compact (UNGC): The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) is a significant 
initiative with over 9,500 companies and 3,000 non-business signatories across 160+ countries, spanning 
civil society, government bodies, investor groups, academia, and 70 local networks. It fosters responsible 
business practices by aligning strategies with ten core principles related to human rights, labor, 
environment, and anti-corruption. This voluntary effort encourages businesses to contribute to societal 
goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aiming to mobilize a global movement of responsible 
enterprises and drive actions for a sustainable world. The UNGC emphasizes multi-sectoral collaborations, 
transformative partnerships, and action platforms engaging diverse stakeholders to address complex 
challenges and achieve SDGs through scalable impacts and time-bound deliverables. 
Gender and Energy Compact: The Gender and Energy Compact, led by ENERGIA, GWNET, and UNIDO, is a 
global coalition focused on advancing gender equality and women's empowerment in the context of a just, 
inclusive, and sustainable energy transition. Comprising stakeholders from governments, private sector, 
academia, civil society, youth, and international organizations, this coalition aims to achieve two core 
goals: ensuring women have equal opportunities to lead, participate in, and benefit from a sustainable 
energy transition, and granting women equal access to and control over sustainable energy products and 
services. Through joint commitments and individual Energy Compacts submitted by signatories, the 
Compact strives to eliminate energy and time poverty, foster gender-responsive energy policies, enhance 
women's entrepreneurship and career advancement, and promote gender-responsive knowledge and 
data availability by 2030. These efforts target the achievement of SDG7 on universal access to sustainable 
energy and SDG5 on gender equality through tangible outcomes, including increased resources for 
women-led 
businesses, 
improved 
employment 
opportunities, 
and 
more 
 
 
comprehensive data and tools for gender-responsive policy formulation and evaluation. 
UNDP’s Sustainable Energy Hub: The UNDP Sustainable Energy Hub collaborates with governments, UN-
Energy, member states, the private sector, and civil society to facilitate a just and sustainable energy 
transition. Their aim is to support countries in achieving SDG 7 by providing clean, affordable energy to an 
additional 500 million people by 2025. The Sustainable Energy Hub aims to mobilize partnerships to 
accelerate the low carbon transition and renewable energy revolution.  
Powering Healthcare Hub: The Powering Healthcare Hub, driven by SEforALL and in collaboration with 
other stakeholders, aims to resolve the issue of inadequate or unreliable electricity access in healthcare 
facilities, impacting around one billion people globally. This initiative offers a centralized platform providing 
data, best practices, and leadership to facilitate the electrification of health facilities. It addresses the 
estimated requirement of USD 5 billion for electrifying health facilities in South Asia and Sub-Saharan 
Africa, integrating innovative technologies and business models. SEforALL's Powering Healthcare program 
underpins this initiative, empowering governments and development partners with evidence and 
solutions to achieve sustainable electrification of health facilities by 2030. The program aims to inspire 
stronger commitments, increase investments, and enhance the sustainability of interventions, 
contributing to universal, sustainable electrification in the healthcare sector. 
 
Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves: The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, hosted by the UN 
Foundation, is a public-private partnership uniting over 1300 partners from governments, multilateral 
organizations, the private sector, NGOs, academia, and philanthropy. Established to create a thriving 
market for clean household cooking solutions, its objectives include saving lives, enhancing livelihoods, 
and preserving the environment, recognizing particularly the impact on women due to traditional cooking 
methods. Focused on promoting clean and efficient cooking (SDG7) and empowering women by reducing 
their exposure to indoor air pollution (SDG5), the Alliance seeks to reach 100 million households by 2020.  
To achieve this, it concentrates on catalyzing the sector, attracting investments, advocating for change, 
setting standards, conducting research, and advocating globally. This partnership addresses global needs, 
prioritizes market-based solutions, and coordinates a comprehensive strategy for clean cooking solutions' 
widespread adoption, emphasizing accessibility and sustainability. This alliance has developed an 
“Introductory Framework for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification for Clean Cooking Energy 
Initiatives” (links) 
 
Global Platform for Action (GPA) on Sustainable Energy in Displacement Settings: The Global Platform 
for Action (GPA) on Sustainable Energy in Displacement Settings operates as a united effort hosted by 
UNITAR to ensure sustainable energy access in humanitarian contexts. It collaborates with energy, 
development, and humanitarian partners to transition towards renewable energy, 
aiming to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and cut emissions. GPA focuses on local 
solutions, gender sensitivity, and financial sustainability across five thematic areas. 
Global Interventions Map: The Global Interventions database provides a one-stop sectoral overview 
of the work happening around the world to electrify healthcare facilities, and aids stakeholders in 
identifying opportunities for coordination and collaboration. 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:

1. Number of companies and non-business signatories in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) across different countries.
2. Number of stakeholders involved in the Gender and Energy Compact.
3. Progress towards achieving SDG7 on universal access to sustainable energy and SDG5 on gender equality through the Gender and Energy Compact.
4. Number of people impacted by inadequate or unreliable electricity access in healthcare facilities globally.
5. Number of partners in the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.
6. Number of households reached by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.

Ideas for infographics:

1. A world map showing the distribution of companies and non-business signatories in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) across different countries.
2. A bar chart comparing the number of stakeholders involved in the Gender and Energy Compact from different sectors (government, private sector, academia, civil society, etc.).
3. A line graph showing the progress towards achieving SDG7 and SDG5 through the Gender and Energy Compact over time.
4. A pie chart showing the percentage of healthcare facilities globally impacted by inadequate or unreliable electricity access.
5. A network diagram showing the partnerships and collaborations within the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.
6. A stacked bar chart showing the number of households reached by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves in different regions or countries.

Design recommendations:

1. The world map should use different colors or shading to represent the number of companies and non-business signatories in each country, with a legend indicating the range of values.
2. The bar chart should use different colors for each sector and include labels for each bar to clearly identify the number of stakeholders.
3. The line graph should have two lines, one for each SDG, and use different colors to distinguish between them. The x-axis should represent time, and the y-axis should represent the progress towards the goals.
4. The pie chart should use different colors to represent the percentage of healthcare facilities impacted, and each slice should be labeled with the corresponding percentage.
5. The network diagram should use nodes to represent partners and lines to represent collaborations, with different colors or shapes for different types of partners.
6. The stacked bar chart should use different colors to represent the number of households reached in each region or country, with a legend indicating the values for each color.

Overall, the infographics should be visually appealing, easy to understand, and clearly convey the data points mentioned above. They should also include relevant labels, legends, and titles to provide context and enhance comprehension.

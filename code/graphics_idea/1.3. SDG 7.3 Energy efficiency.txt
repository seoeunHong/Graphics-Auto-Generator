 
 
on community cohesion and violate legitimate land tenure rights (SDG 1). Documented human rights 
abuses, including threats, land grabs and harm to indigenous communities, highlight the need for 
establishing clear policies to protect human rights, involving stakeholders, and providing accessible 
redress mechanisms in renewable energy projects (OHCHR, 2016) (CCSI, 2023). For instance, the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights outline steps companies must take to respect human 
rights and provide remedies for harms their operations cause or contribute to (Amnesty, 2023). A socio-
economic footprint analysis of the energy transition performed by IRENA in South Africa and Egypt, 
enhance the comprehensive assessment of renewable energy potential impacts on environment, people 
and livelihoods protection and jobs creation (Box 13).

Box 13: IRENA's assessment of the energy transition's socio-economic impact in South Africa and 
Egypt builds on its World Energy Transitions Outlook. This effort aims to support transition planning 
and informed policymaking. The South African report showcases a wind project and the establishment 
of a Small-Medium Enterprise focused on bird monitoring. This project enhanced positive socio-
economic impacts on local communities by creating new professional opportunities for disadvantaged 
community members and fostering bird protection mechanisms. 
 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:

1. The documented human rights abuses, including threats, land grabs, and harm to indigenous communities in renewable energy projects.
2. The steps outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights that companies must take to respect human rights and provide remedies for harms caused by their operations.
3. The socio-economic footprint analysis of the energy transition performed by IRENA in South Africa and Egypt.

Ideas for infographics:

1. Infographic on Human Rights Abuses in Renewable Energy Projects:
   - Design: Use a combination of icons, illustrations, and photographs to depict the different types of human rights abuses mentioned in the passage.
   - Information: Show statistics on the number of documented abuses, the affected communities, and the types of abuses (threats, land grabs, harm to indigenous communities).
   - Include a timeline to show the progression of these abuses over time.

2. Infographic on UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights:
   - Design: Use a flowchart or a step-by-step process to visually represent the steps outlined in the UN Guiding Principles.
   - Information: Explain each step in a concise and easy-to-understand manner, highlighting the importance of respecting human rights and providing remedies for harms caused by business operations.
   - Include examples or case studies of companies that have successfully implemented these principles.

3. Infographic on Socio-economic Footprint Analysis of the Energy Transition:
   - Design: Use a map or a combination of maps and charts to visually represent the socio-economic impacts of the energy transition in South Africa and Egypt.
   - Information: Show the positive impacts on local communities, such as job creation and professional opportunities for disadvantaged community members.
   - Include data on the number of jobs created, the types of professional opportunities, and the specific mechanisms put in place to protect the environment and livelihoods.

Overall, the infographics should be visually appealing, easy to understand, and convey the importance of protecting human rights and considering socio-economic impacts in renewable energy projects.

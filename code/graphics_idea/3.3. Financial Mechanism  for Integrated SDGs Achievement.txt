3.3. Financial Mechanism for Integrated SDGs Achievement 
Optimized financing has the potential to unlock substantial savings. Initiatives such as the Africa Minigrids 
Program showcase the potential of kickstarting large-scale private investments by developing early-stage 
minigrid markets. This section explores financial mechanisms for achieving integrated SDGs. It begins by 
examining the evolving financial landscape within the new investment paradigm, discussing shifts and

Example: Partnering for Transformative SDG-Oriented Urban Development, Guidance for Multi-
Partner Initiatives from the Global Future Cities Program, UN-Habitat 
Based on experiences from the Global Future Cities Program (GFCP), this report provides guidance to 
international donors, city authorities, UN agencies, and delivery partners about how to design and run 
multi-partner urban development initiatives that drive transformative impact and accelerate SDG 
implementation in rapidly urbanizing cities. 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
1. The Joint Program Cycle mentioned in Figure 13 could be represented as a flowchart or timeline to visually depict the different stages and processes involved.
2. The financial mechanism for integrated SDGs achievement could be represented through a bar chart or pie chart to show the allocation of funds or investments in different sectors or initiatives.
3. The evolving financial landscape and shifts in investment priorities could be represented through a line graph or area chart to show the trends over time.

Ideas for infographics:
1. Infographic on the Joint Program Cycle: This infographic could include a visual representation of the different stages in the cycle, along with brief descriptions of each stage. It could also include icons or symbols to represent the key activities or processes involved in each stage.
2. Infographic on the financial mechanism for integrated SDGs achievement: This infographic could include a bar chart or pie chart to show the allocation of funds or investments in different sectors or initiatives. It could also include icons or symbols to represent each sector or initiative, along with brief descriptions of their importance and impact.
3. Infographic on the evolving financial landscape: This infographic could include a line graph or area chart to show the trends in investment priorities over time.

Main take-home messages 
1) Amplify your critical thinking skills to advance the Energy and Sustainable Development Nexus 
Access to electricity and clean cooking acts as a catalyst for achieving multiple SDGs, necessitating a focus 
on energy affordability and sufficiency, sustainable battery management, and inclusive, gender-responsive 
approaches. Renewable energies contribute to sustainable prosperity, requiring a holistic approach to 
manage trade-offs, address water security challenges, and ensure governance. Energy efficiency is pivotal 
for catalyzing sustainability but demands attention to avoid development degrowth, mitigate large-scale 
impacts, engage society through capacity-building, and reduce inequalities through digitalization. 
2) Leverage strategic approaches and tools for maximizing impact across multiple SDGs  
Four approaches revolutionize project design and implementation by adopting a systemic perspective, 
gender mainstreaming, human rights-based principles, and a portfolio approach for interconnected 
interventions. Operationalizing nexus projects relies on critical tools such as water-energy-food nexus 
methods, life cycle assessments, multi-criteria tools, scenario thinking, theory of 
change, and digital intelligence for informed, data-driven decisions. 
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES 
• 
Addressing SDG interlinkages requires collective strength, and the evolving UN 
ecosystem serves as an enabling platform for collaboration. Under the UN-Energy compacts, 
coalitions, alliances, hubs, and public-private partnerships are shaping the landscape, 
addressing energy's interconnectedness with gender, healthcare, clean cooking, resilience 
for displaced people, green economy, and digital finance services. Joint programs and inter-
agency initiatives exemplify innovative solutions, serving as sources of inspiration, while 
multi-stakeholder knowledge and data platforms promote experiences sharing. 
• 
Building and managing effective multi-stakeholder partnerships for SDG progress 
involves embracing the dynamic partnership lifecycle, understanding stakeholders, 
maximizing partnership value, and operating under institutional readiness. Developing 
effective and transformative joint programs, attractive for investment, necessitate catalyzing 
policy changes, government ownership, aligned roles and responsibilities, quality standards, 
and joint management for results. 
• 
Joint funds, investing networks, partnership funds are shaping the financial landscape 
explicitly to address SDG interlinkages. Innovative financial schemes are arising to be 
leveraged, such as blended finance and impact investing, with digital intelligence playing a 
key role. Financing frameworks, platforms, and tools are emerging to facilitate the match 
between bankable projects and transition and climate finances. 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
- The different approaches for maximizing impact across multiple SDGs
- The evolving UN ecosystem and its various initiatives and partnerships
- The financial landscape and the different financing frameworks and tools available

Ideas for infographics:
1) A flowchart or diagram illustrating the different approaches for maximizing impact across multiple SDGs, such as the systemic perspective, gender mainstreaming, human rights-based principles, and the portfolio approach. This infographic should visually show how these approaches are interconnected and can be applied in project design and implementation.

2) A visual representation of the evolving UN ecosystem, showcasing the different UN-Energy compacts, coalitions, alliances, hubs, and public-private partnerships that are addressing energy's interconnectedness with various sectors such as gender, healthcare, clean cooking, resilience for displaced people, green economy, and digital finance services. This infographic should highlight the collaborative nature of these initiatives and how they contribute to addressing SDG interlinkages.

3) A graphic illustrating the different financial schemes and tools that are shaping the financial landscape to address SDG interlinkages. This infographic should showcase the blended finance and impact investing models, as well as the role of digital intelligence in facilitating financing for sustainable projects. It should also highlight the emerging financing frameworks, platforms, and tools that help match bankable projects with transition and climate finances.

Design recommendations:
- Use clear and concise visuals, such as icons, symbols, and illustrations, to represent the different approaches, initiatives, and financial schemes.
- Utilize a color scheme that is visually appealing and helps differentiate between the different elements in the graphics.
- Include brief captions or labels to provide context and explanation for each element in the graphics.
- Ensure that the graphics are easy to understand and navigate, with a logical flow and organization of information.
- Consider using a combination of charts, diagrams, and illustrations to convey the information effectively.

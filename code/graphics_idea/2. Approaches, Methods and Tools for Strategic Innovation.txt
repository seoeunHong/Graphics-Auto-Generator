This chapter explores ways to uncover system interconnections and foster integration across the SDGs. It 
aims at equipping participants with an understanding of why a focus on system interconnections is key for 
achieving sustainable development, what coherent policymaking entails, and what are some specific 
approaches, methods and tools that can be employed to foster SDGs interlinkages. Approaches are 
intended to guide the overarching strategy, methods define the step-by-step procedures, and tools provide 
the means to execute those procedures effectively within the chosen approach and method. For instance, 
the UNDP’s Knowledge Bank offers a one-stop-shop resource platform, including the SDG Integration tools 
and the SDG Acceleration Toolkit by the UNSDG, serving as a comprehensive support hub for achieving 
the Global Goals (SDG Acceleration Toolkit) 
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES 
• 
Access to electricity and clean cooking acts as a catalyst for achieving multiple SDGs, 
facilitating educational opportunities, bridging the digital divide, transforming health services, 
addressing water stress, bolstering food security and productive development, and narrowing 
the gender gaps. Special attention must be given to balancing energy affordability and 
sufficiency, ensuring sustainable battery management, and applying an inclusive, gender-
responsive lens to leave no one behind. 
• 
Renewable energies pave the way for sustainable prosperity, contributing to the 
synergistic fight against climate change, creating healthier cities, and fostering resilient 
societies. These technological solutions require a holistic approach to manage potential 
trade-offs, such as water security challenges, balancing land use and food security, 
considering the entire environmental footprint of the green energy value chain, and ensuring 
governance and community rights. 
• 
Energy efficiency represents a highly advantageous strategy capable of catalyzing 
sustainability by building sustainable societies, optimizing the water-food-energy nexus, 
transforming the energy sector and industry through waste-to-energy solutions and 
digitalization. However, attention is needed to avoid development degrowth, to mitigate 
scaled impacts of large-scale initiatives such as nature-based solutions, to engage society 
through capacity-building and reduce inequalities through digitalization. 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
- The multiple SDGs that access to electricity and clean cooking can facilitate, such as educational opportunities, bridging the digital divide, transforming health services, addressing water stress, bolstering food security, and narrowing gender gaps.
- The potential trade-offs and challenges associated with renewable energies, such as water security, land use, food security, environmental footprint, governance, and community rights.
- The advantages and benefits of energy efficiency, such as building sustainable societies, optimizing the water-food-energy nexus, transforming the energy sector and industry, waste-to-energy solutions, and digitalization.

Ideas for infographics:
1. A circular diagram showing the interconnectedness of the SDGs that access to electricity and clean cooking can facilitate. Each SDG can be represented by a different color, and arrows can show how they are linked to each other through access to electricity and clean cooking.
2. A bar chart comparing the potential trade-offs and challenges associated with different renewable energy sources. Each challenge can be represented by a bar, and the height of the bar can indicate the severity of the challenge.
3. A before-and-after infographic showing the benefits of energy efficiency in different sectors, such as buildings, transportation, and industry. The "before" section can show the current situation, while the "after" section can show the positive impacts of energy efficiency measures, such as reduced energy consumption and emissions.
4. A flowchart illustrating the steps involved in implementing energy efficiency measures, from identifying opportunities to implementing and monitoring the measures. Each step can be represented by a box, and arrows can show the flow of the process.

Design recommendations:
- Use clear and concise labels for each data point or step in the infographic.
- Use colors that are visually appealing and help differentiate between different data points or steps.
- Include relevant icons or illustrations to enhance understanding and engagement.
- Use a consistent and easy-to-read font throughout the infographic.
- Ensure that the size and layout of the infographic are suitable for both digital and print formats.
- Include a title or heading that clearly conveys the main message or topic of the infographic.

        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:

1. The number of UN and international bodies involved in the Global Plan of Action on Energy Access for Crisis-Affected Communities (GPA).
2. The number of UN agencies and partner countries involved in the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE).
3. The number of members in the Better Than Cash Alliance, categorized by national governments, global brands, and humanitarian NGOs.
4. The different components of the United Nations Office for Partnerships (UN Partnerships), such as the SDG Advocates, Strategy Hub, climate action mobilization, UNDEF, and UNFIP.

Ideas for infographics:

1. A network diagram showing the different UN and international bodies involved in the GPA, with arrows indicating their relationships and collaborations.
2. A world map showing the partner countries involved in PAGE, with different colors or symbols representing the level of progress in transforming their economies into drivers of sustainability.
3. A bar chart showing the distribution of members in the Better Than Cash Alliance, categorized by national governments, global brands, and humanitarian NGOs.
4. A visual representation of the different components of UN Partnerships, such as a wheel diagram with each component as a section, showing how they work together to drive SDGs.

Design recommendations:

1. The network diagram should have clear labels for each organization and use different colors or shapes to differentiate them. Arrows should be labeled with the type of collaboration or support provided.
2. The world map should use a color gradient to represent the level of progress in each partner country, with a legend indicating the different shades of color.
3. The bar chart should have a clear title and axis labels, and each category should be represented by a different color. The length of each bar should correspond to the number of members in that category.
4. The wheel diagram should have each component labeled and use different colors or patterns to differentiate them. The size of each section should correspond to its importance or level of activity within UN Partnerships.

development, aiding stakeholders in envisioning multiple futures and addressing complex problems, 
fostering collaboration, supporting quantitative analysis, and offering engaging narratives about 
sustainable societies (UNESCAP, 2015) (SDGs UN, 2016). 
 
2.2.5. Theory of Change  
A Theory of Change method explains how interventions drive specific development changes based on 
causal analysis and evidence. It clarifies pathways from outputs to outcomes, aiding in planning and 
evaluating initiatives. This approach tackles complex problems, supports learning cycles, fosters 
partnerships, and acts as a concise communication tool. By outlining causal pathways, identifying needs 
and assumptions, and engaging partners, it helps understand and address underlying challenges. When 
applied to SDGs, it helps in understanding the interconnections between actions and impacts, aiding in 
the planning and evaluation of initiatives. The Theory of Change methodology involves a consultative and 
evidence-based approach, focusing on continuous learning and improvement while ensuring clarity and 
quality in program design and implementation. This method guides program design and fosters continuous 
learning and partnership development (UNEP, 2023)(UNICEF)(UNSDG).

Tool: Energy Moonshot AI Data Platform (UNDP) 
To bring clean energy to 500 million more people by 2025 and drive the shift to renewables, a fresh 
approach is vital. The Energy Moonshot AI Data Platform is breaking new ground, combining AI and 
geospatial data to offer unparalleled insights for energy projects worldwide. This tool empowers local 
action, tapping into global innovation. Refined by using cutting-edge technology, like Large Language 
Models, it supports technical officers and development efforts by providing energy insights. 
Automation features optimize project monitoring and reporting, offering live beneficiary updates. 
Through collaboration, this platform aims to seamlessly integrate AI advancements into energy policy 
and planning. 
 
 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:

- The number of people targeted to have access to clean energy by 2025 (500 million)
- The use of AI and geospatial data in the Energy Moonshot AI Data Platform
- The impact of the Energy Moonshot AI Data Platform on energy projects worldwide
- The integration of AI advancements into energy policy and planning

Ideas for infographics:

1. Infographic on the impact of the Energy Moonshot AI Data Platform:
   - Design: Use a world map as the background, with dots or icons representing energy projects that have benefited from the platform.
   - Information: Show the number of projects, the regions they are located in, and the specific benefits they have achieved (e.g., increased access to clean energy, reduced carbon emissions).

2. Infographic on the number of people targeted to have access to clean energy by 2025:
   - Design: Use a bar chart or a pie chart to visually represent the target number (500 million) in comparison to the current number of people with access to clean energy.
   - Information: Show the current number of people with access to clean energy, the target number, and the progress made towards achieving the target.

3. Infographic on the integration of AI advancements into energy policy and planning:
   - Design: Use a flowchart or a timeline to illustrate the process of integrating AI advancements into energy policy and planning.
   - Information: Show the different stages or steps involved, such as data collection, analysis, policy formulation, and implementation, highlighting the role of AI at each stage.

4. Infographic on the use of AI and geospatial data in the Energy Moonshot AI Data Platform:
   - Design: Use a combination of icons and illustrations to represent AI and geospatial data.
   - Information: Explain how AI and geospatial data are used in the platform, such as analyzing energy patterns, identifying suitable locations for renewable energy projects, and optimizing project monitoring and reporting.

These infographics should be visually appealing, with clear and concise information. They should also include captions or short descriptions to provide additional context and explanation.

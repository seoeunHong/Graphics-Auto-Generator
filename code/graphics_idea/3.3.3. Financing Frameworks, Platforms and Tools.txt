Budgeting for SDGs (B4SDG): Budgeting for Sustainable Development Goals (B4SDG) involves integrating 
SDGs into public finance and fiscal planning, championed by UNDP. It supports strategic budgeting, 
enabling SDG integration into frameworks, classification systems, and fostering public engagement for 
accountability. This process aligns with countries’ efforts to meet the 2030 Agenda, incorporating 17 
universal SDGs with 169 targets. B4SDG facilitates the translation of high-level policies into budget 
decisions, enhancing efficiency, equity, and effectiveness in achieving SDGs. The steps entail contextual 
analysis, reviewing the public financial management system, assessing institutions, modeling the most 
relevant tools for reforms, and formulating reform offers. Through these efforts, B4SDG aims to bridge 
policy and budget systems, ensuring coherence, transparency, and accountability, essential for SDG 
implementation. This initiative caters to UN agencies and national governments, aiding in SDG 
mainstreaming, planning, and budgeting processes, contributing significantly to the Integrated National 
Financing Frameworks (INFFs). 
 
3.3.3. Financing Frameworks, Platforms and Tools 
UNDP Sustainable Finance Hub (SFH): The Sustainable Finance Hub (SFH), spearheaded by the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is a strategic initiative aimed at catalyzing finance for the SDGs. 
The SFH engages governments, civil society, and the private sector to prioritize SDG-
aligned investments. This initiative facilitates access to private investors, designs 
Partners Group PG Life Strategy: Partners Group introduced PG LIFE to meet client demands for 
investments in line with UN SDGs, focusing on healthcare, education, and clean energy. Operating 
across private markets for pension and sovereign wealth funds, it uses an Impact Committee and an 
external LIFE Council to ensure SDG alignment. The strategy integrates SDGs at every investment stage, 
from sourcing to management, emphasizing impact metrics post-investment. An investment example, 
Techem, offers heat and water sub-metering services, reducing utility costs in Europe, UAE, Turkey, 
and Brazil, aligning with SDG 6 and 7 by enhancing energy and water efficiency, also leading to 
substantial CO2 emission reductions. 
 
 
innovative financial instruments, supports national financing frameworks, and fosters knowledge sharing 
on sustainable finance practices. Collaborations span UNDP Country Offices, the Istanbul International 
Center for Private Sector in Development (IICPSD), international financial institutions, business leaders, 
faith-based finance partners, and UN agencies like UNDESA, UNICEF, UN Women, and UNCDF. The 
overarching goal is to establish an inclusive economic governance architecture that mobilizes substantial 
resources towards the $1 trillion ‘Moonshot’ target for the SDGs, driving systemic reforms and enhancing 
alignment and capacity for sustainable finance. The UNDP's Sustainable Finance Service offers a 4+1 
solution including: Public Finance, Unlocking Private Capital for SDG alignment, SDG Impact Management 
& Finance Tracking, Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs) & Portfolios, and the SDG Finance 
Academy.  
 
 
SDG Investor Platform: The SDG Investor Platform, led by the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) in partnership with the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance, acts as a 
comprehensive resource offering crucial data and insights for investors to direct capital towards 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By employing a rigorous methodology rooted in extensive 
research and stakeholder input, it identifies global investment opportunities aligned with SDGs. Leveraging 
partnerships with specialized partners and UNDP Country Offices, the platform provides localized 
investment and impact data, aiding comprehensive understanding. Its goal is to empower investors with 
the necessary tools to drive capital towards SDGs while assisting countries in securing vital post-COVID-19 
financing for advancement, ultimately benefiting both human well-being and environmental sustainability. 
The platform integrates UNDP’s SDG investor Map, a country-specific market intelligence tool that 
translates SDG needs and policy priorities into actionable investment opportunity areas. 
UNDP’s SDG Finance Academy: The SDG Finance Academy, launched by the Sustainable Finance Hub, 
aims to achieve the $1 trillion SDG target. This Academy offers comprehensive training across four 
core areas: Public Finance, Private Capital Alignment, SDG Impact Management, and National 
Financing Frameworks. Tailored for UNDP staff in 170 countries and external stakeholders, it provides 
knowledge on financial tools, their alignment with SDGs, implications for policy reform, and 
customization for national development needs. The Academy operates through learning sessions, 
community building, expert curation, and engagement facilitation and offers customizable training for 
public and private sectors, emphasizing the interconnectedness of SDG finance principles.  
 
 
 
 
Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF): The Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs) 
are a mechanism designed to finance national sustainable development priorities and operationalize the 
Addis Ababa Action Agenda at the country level. They serve as a planning and delivery tool, bridging the 
gap between a country's sustainable development strategy and the means to finance and implement it, 
utilizing diverse public and private financing sources. INFFs aim to bolster planning processes, surmount 
obstacles, and mobilize resources—both domestic and global—to support sustainable development and 
the SDGs. These frameworks essentially guide the financing of national strategies and prioritize the 
accomplishment of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs. INFFs operate via four essential building blocks: 
assessment and diagnostics, financing strategy, monitoring and review, governance, and coordination. 
These blocks collectively enhance a nation's ability to strategically plan and manage sustainable 
development financing. Activities within each block iteratively reinforce progress in others, leveraging 
existing structures and mechanisms within national frameworks. While the core components remain 
constant, actions within these blocks vary by country, culminating in an INFF tailored to each nation's 
distinct capacities, vulnerabilities, and priorities. INFF are fostering integrated financing solutions 
advancing toward sustainable energy and other SDGs’ interlinkages in Tanzania and Azerbaijan. 
 
SDG Investor Map: The SDG Investor Maps are country-specific tools developed by the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) to bridge the gap between interest and investment in Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). These innovative maps employ a rigorous eight-step methodology 
involving comprehensive desk research and consultations with public and private sectors within 
countries. By identifying overlaps between development needs and policy priorities, these maps 
validate potential impactful and investable business models. The goal is to transform SDG needs and 
policy priorities into actionable investment opportunities, directing capital towards emerging markets 
where SDG priorities align with government policies and market opportunities.

Climate Investment Platform: The Climate Investment Platform (CIP), led by IRENA in collaboration with 
UNDP, SEforALL, and GCF, aims to bolster renewable energy impact investing in developing nations. It 
offers tailored technical assistance and finance matchmaking to advance renewable energy technologies. 
The platform invites renewable energy projects aligned with SDGs and national climate priorities to seek 
support beyond conceptual stages. CIP's Investment Forums, organized around sub-regional clusters, focus 
on project pipeline development and dialogue fostering improved investment conditions. These forums 
aim to enhance bankable proposals, facilitate investment matchmaking, and encourage dialogue for better 
investment frameworks. The platform's strategic approach includes continuous support for projects 
attracting investor interest and capacity building for policy enhancement and technical areas, aiming to 
fortify renewable energy landscapes in developing countries. 
Development Finance Assessment (DFA) tool: The Development Finance Assessment (DFA) tool, led by 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), serves as a multi-stakeholder mechanism 
addressing the complex challenge of financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It aims to 
mobilize additional resources and optimize existing funds for sustainable development. The DFA operates 
as a government-led process, engaging various stakeholders from governments, private sectors, NGOs, 
and international financial institutions. Its analytical framework evaluates and enhances integrated 
planning and financing functions, fostering public-private collaboration and accountability. Through this 
approach, the DFA aims to bridge the gap between national planning and finance policies, fostering 
consensus-driven solutions and creating roadmaps for achieving SDGs. UNDP’s comprehensive guidebook 
supports countries in this endeavor, providing a structured approach for officials, UNDP offices, and 
diverse stakeholders involved in the DFA process, complemented by practical country examples to enhance 
SDG financing integration. 
Mobilizing private finance through INFF:  
In Tanzania, INFFs are driving private investment by identifying SDG-aligned opportunities across 
sectors like agriculture, education, and renewable energy. Thirteen investment opportunity areas 
(IOAs) have been pinpointed, attracting investments in solar solutions for community systems and 
empowering rural women through edible oil crop farming.  
In Azerbaijan, the INFF focuses on reducing fossil fuel dependence by steering investments toward 
green energy and sustainable agriculture. The government aims to collaborate with the private sector 
and global community to reshape policies, scale up SDG programs, and transition to a green growth 
economy, mitigating inequalities and environmental risks tied to the extractive industry.

The Budget Intelligence Toolkit (BIT): The Budget Intelligence Toolkit (BIT) by the United Nations Economic 
and Social Commission for Western Asia (UN ESCWA) utilizes machine learning for fiscal incidence analysis 
on budget expenditures and their impacts on the 17 SDGs and over 100 measurable indicators. It aims to 
enhance public financial management across planning, spending, delivery, and evaluation stages. By 
identifying budget allocations positively influencing SDG progress, it aids policymakers in optimizing public 
spending. The BIT was piloted in Egypt, revealing numerous direct and indirect links between government 
expenditures and SDG performance, indicating the country's potential for SDG progress through its 
spending patterns. This tool offers insights to optimize spending efficiency, assess impacts, and align 
budgets effectively with SDG objectives, partnering with ministries, central banks, and national 
stakeholders. 
 
Financing the 2030 Agenda, Guidebook for UNDP Country Offices: UNDP developed the “An Introductory 
Guidebook for UNDP Country Offices”. This guidebook provides an overview of current and recent trends 
in financing for development and explores their implications for the financing of the 2030 Agenda. Then 
UNDP’s approach for providing country level support on financing for development is also presented. Then 
is detailed UNDP’s current portfolio of work on financing for development, and information on the tools 
and services provided, and where to source more information. Finally, the guidebook describes some of 
the most widely-used financial instruments as well as innovative finance mechanisms and looks at their 
pros and cons (UNDP, 2018). 
BIT outcomes in Egypt: In Egypt's fiscal year 2020, over a quarter of the budget supported "people" 
and "prosperity," with significant allocations to infrastructure, utilities, and economic growth. This 
allocation strategy notably improved outcomes related to SDGs 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8, especially in health, 
education, water, sanitation, energy, and economic growth. On average, 34% of government spending 
contributed to advancing social protection linked to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 11.

The previous section explored Sustainable Energy's links with other SDGs and integrated methodologies. 
SDG 7.a stresses funding and collaboration for clean energy, while SDG 17 underscores strengthening 
global partnerships for Sustainable Development. Enhanced partnerships accelerate SDG progress by 
leveraging synergies and avoiding trade-offs. Across contexts, organizations, and projects, international 
partnerships assume diverse roles in SDG implementation. They harness expertise and 
resources from international organizations, NGOs, governments, and the private 
Tool: SDG Push Diagnostic (UNDP) 
The UNDP's SDG Push initiative aims to drive COVID-recovery by exploring pathways toward achieving 
the SDGs by 2030. Their SDG Push Diagnostic offers reports from 94 countries, presenting 
development landscapes and policy choices made within fiscal constraints. This dynamic visualization 
tool integrates multiple data sources to analyze SDG trends, national priorities, and interlinkages, 
outlining potential pathways beyond 2030. It provides insights into challenges, growth trajectories, 
environmental sustainability, and inclusiveness (SDG Moment), aligns national priorities with SDGs 
using machine learning (Trends & Priorities), maps synergies and trade-offs for policy pathways (SDG 
Interlinkages), and offers fiscal insights and stimulus options for progress acceleration (Finance & 
Stimulus). This comprehensive approach leverages data, AI, and systems intelligence to support 
countries in accelerating progress toward the SDGs 
 
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES 
• 
Four approaches can revolutionize the way projects are designed, implemented, and 
evaluated, simultaneously addressing the world's primary challenges. System thinking views 
issues as interconnected systems rather than isolated parts, allowing a holistic understanding 
of the problems. Gender mainstreaming is the recipe for gender equality, necessitating the 
consideration of gender as an analytical variable throughout the project, program or policy 
cycle. A human rights-based approach ensures the fulfillment of people-centered goals, 
shifting the focus from basic needs to rights. The portfolio approach involves developing an 
interconnected network of interventions instead of isolated projects, promoting synergetic 
solutions and ensuring adaptability to uncertainties and resilience. 
• 
Methods and tools serve as the operational backbone for nexus projects: Water-
energy-food nexus methods are crucial for advancing water, food, and energy security 
simultaneously; Life cycle assessments allow viewing the entire system cycle for sustainable 
decision-making; Multi-criteria tools enable balancing conflicting criteria in the decision-
making process, incorporating stakeholder perspectives; Scenario thinking visualizes the 
impacts of decisions; Theory of change articulates the steps driving desired changes; and 
Digital intelligence emerges as the tool for big data-driven decision-making, allowing 
accurate predictions and data patterns identification. 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
1. The number of international partnerships involved in SDG implementation.
2. The growth trajectories of countries in relation to SDG progress.
3. The potential pathways beyond 2030 for achieving the SDGs.
4. The synergies and trade-offs for policy pathways in relation to the SDGs.
5. The fiscal insights and stimulus options for progress acceleration towards the SDGs.

Ideas for infographics:
1. A network diagram showing the interconnectedness of international partnerships involved in SDG implementation.
2. A line graph showing the growth trajectories of countries in relation to SDG progress.
3. A flowchart illustrating the potential pathways beyond 2030 for achieving the SDGs.
4. A matrix showing the synergies and trade-offs for policy pathways in relation to the SDGs.
5. A bar chart showing the fiscal insights and stimulus options for progress acceleration towards the SDGs.

Design recommendations:
1. The network diagram should use different colors or shapes to represent different types of partnerships and should include labels for each partnership.
2. The line graph should have clear labels for the x-axis (years) and y-axis (SDG progress) and should use different colors or lines to represent different countries.
3. The flowchart should have clear labels for each pathway and should use arrows to show the progression from one pathway to another.
4. The matrix should use different colors or shading to represent the level of synergy or trade-off for each policy pathway.
5. The bar chart should have clear labels for the x-axis (fiscal insights and stimulus options) and y-axis (progress acceleration) and should use different colors or patterns to represent different options.

Overall, the infographics should be visually appealing, easy to understand, and should effectively convey the data and information related to SDG partnerships, growth trajectories, potential pathways, synergies and trade-offs, and fiscal insights.

 
 
the UN Secretary-Generalâ€™s Digital Cooperation Roadmap and Common Agenda, emphasizing its 
significance. Mapping schools allows effective resource allocation, guides emergency response efforts and 
ensures quality internet access, addressing data inequity and highlighting infrastructure gaps for better 
investment opportunities. Giga ultimately aims to establish market demand, encouraging internet service 
providers to expand infrastructure to remote areas, reducing disparities and fostering global connectivity. 
United for Efficiency:  The United for Efficiency (U4E) initiative, under the leadership of the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP), spearheads a global effort focused on aiding developing nations and 
emerging economies in transitioning towards energy-efficient appliances and equipment. U4E operates 
through a multi-stakeholder approach, collaborating with diverse partners, including UNEP, the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF), UNDP, industry leaders like the International Copper Association (ICA), CLASP, 
and NRDC. This initiative's primary objectives involve informing policymakers about the benefits of high-
efficiency products, promoting best practices, offering tailored assistance to governments in developing 
and implementing strategies, and extending its scope beyond efficient lighting to encompass various high-
efficiency products. U4E's core emphasis lies in reducing global electricity demand, mitigating climate 
change, and enhancing quality of life by optimizing energy usage. Its comprehensive approach addresses 
electricity wastage, pollution, and greenhouse gases, offering financial grants, policy guides, national 
market transformation projects, and capacity-building workshops across various regions, engaging over 60 
partners globally. Academic institutions, industry leaders, and international organizations are part of this 
collaborative effort, supporting countries in their transition to sustainable, energy-efficient products to 
yield significant economic and environmental benefits. 
 
3.1.3. Multi-Stakeholders Knowledge and Data Platforms  
Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD): The Global Partnership for Sustainable 
Development Data is a vast network comprising over 700 organizations spanning private sectors, 
academia, civil society, and governments worldwide. Operating across 35+ countries with a network in 
80+, its primary focus is leveraging the transformative potential of data to drive change aligned with the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By advocating for inclusive, timely, and well-governed data, the 
partnership aims to empower governments to make informed decisions and policies. Their strategic 
approach involves boosting data use through multi-stakeholder collaborations, addressing challenges like 
limited data access and analytical capacity. Their goal is to ensure marginalized groups have representation 
in data processes while promoting accountable data governance as a standard practice, all with the 
ultimate aim of accelerating SDG progress and fostering impactful global change. 
UN Sustainable Development Group: The UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG) operates globally 
as a critical forum driving joint policies, decisions, and investments in line with the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development and its 17 goals. Covering 162 countries and territories, this body oversees and 
coordinates UN efforts worldwide for sustainable development. It translates global decisions into 
actionable initiatives at the country level, as showcased through the UNSDG Data portal (UNINFO). 
Furthermore, at the regional level, the five Regional Collaborative Platforms (RCP) 
unify all UN entities, chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General and co-chaired by key 
 
 
representatives from Regional Economic Commissions and the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP). These RCPs concentrate on cross-border challenges, pooling expertise to cater to the specific 
needs of each region while reinforcing coordination between UN entities and supporting country-level 
work conducted by Resident Coordinators and UN country teams. For instance, the UNESCAP and the Asia-
Pacific UN Development Coordination Office, have led in consultation with the UNSDG the Asia-Pacific 
Knowledge Management Hub. 
 
 
 
 
UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN): The UN Sustainable Development Solutions 
Network (SDSN), established in 2012, operates under the UN Secretary-General to engage universities, 
think tanks, and laboratories in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Paris Agreement 
objectives. This network mobilizes academia, civil society, UN agencies, and the private sector to translate 
scientific evidence into actionable solutions for sustainable development.  As of 2023, the SDSN has over 
1,800 members in 50+ networks across more than 145 countries. It serves as an educational and research 
alliance, facilitating global cooperation, producing vital research reports such as the Sustainable 
Development Report. SDSN's vision involves empowering societies through free online education (SDG 
Academy) and aims to accelerate SDG progress through academic expertise, research contributions, policy 
analysis, and global collaboration. The SDSN Climate & Energy Program is advancing technological 
developments and innovative practices to achieve energy systems decarbonization. 
UNINFO, UNSDG Data Portal: Managed by the UN Development Coordination Office (DCO), the portal 
showcases country-level UN programming, including new Sustainable Development Cooperation 
Frameworks and previous UN Development Assistance Frameworks. Users can access country-specific 
summaries and comprehensive information about the UN Country Team's work via filters and menu 
options. Overseeing sustainable development across 162 countries, UNSDG's data portal, UNINFO, 
offers valuable insights into translating global decisions into actionable progress at the country level. 
 
  
 
Asia-Pacific Knowledge Management Hub: The Asia-Pacific Knowledge Management Hub, 
spearheaded by UNESCAP and the Asia-Pacific UN Development Coordination Office, stands as a 
centralized platform aggregating policy expertise across sectors. This initiative aims to streamline 
access to knowledge resources, SDG-related data, tools, and educational materials, facilitating 
countries and country teams in identifying and responding to emerging national needs aligned with 
the 2030 Agenda. Functioning in close coordination with the regional UN Sustainable Development 
Group, the Hub acts as a repository for SDG-related information, offering a gateway to regional 
statistical data, while also providing access to a network of expertise and practitioners dedicated to 
supporting the effective implementation of sustainable development initiatives.

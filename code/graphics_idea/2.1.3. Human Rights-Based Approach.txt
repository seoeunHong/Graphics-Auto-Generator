2.1.3. Human Rights-Based Approach  
What is it? 
An 
approach 
emphasizing 
the 
fulfillment of human 
rights, 
shifting 
the 
focus from basic needs 
to rights. 
How does it work?  
It 
integrated 
human 
rights 
principles across all phases of 
development 
cooperation, 
aligns 
programming 
with 
international 
standards, 
and 
focuses on capacity building for 
both duty bearers and rights 
holders. 
Why apply it? 
It promotes equality, justice, and dignity 
for all, by addressing inequalities and 
discrimination at the root level. It 
empowers individuals and communities 
to claim their rights and enhances 
accountability and transparency in 
governance. 
Data: The Gender Gap Report – World Economic Forum 
The Global Gender Gap Report, initiated by the World Economic Forum in 2006, benchmarks gender 
parity in economic opportunities, education, health, and political leadership across 146 countries. It 
measures parity scores between men and women, with a score of 1 indicating full parity. The report 
aids strategic planning and policy by identifying disparities and trends, offering a vital tool throughout 
the project cycle for achieving global gender equality. 
 Indicators: Addressing Energy’s Interlinkages with other SDGs 
The SDG 7 Policy Briefs compilation, "Addressing Energy's Interlinkages to Other SDGs" developed by 
the SDG7 Technical Advisory Group (SDG7 TAG), delves into how energy access intertwines with SDG 
5 (gender equality), identifying potential indicators and assessing data availability. This report 
porposes a set of indicators to measure the gender gap in term of: access to electricity and clean 
cooking, employment and leadership, energy entrepreneurship, and the regulatory environment.

Human Rights-Based Approaches (HRBA) are deeply rooted in international human rights standards, 
aimed at safeguarding human rights within developmental landscapes. It emphasizes realizing human 
rights outlined in international agreements to rectify discriminatory practices and rebalance power 
dynamics hindering comprehensive development. HRBA aims to foster equality, justice, and dignity 
beyond basic needs, transforming the narrative towards holistic rights fulfillment. It strengthens 
government capacities to honor rights obligations and empowers communities and individuals to claim 
their rights. Implementing HRBA entails integrating human rights principles across development stages, 
aligning programs with international standards, and capacity-building for duty bearers and rights holders. 
Integrated throughout the project cycle, HRBA ensures program alignment with human rights principles 
from planning to monitoring, enabling redress for violations and fostering engagement. Its advantages 
encompass shifting focus from needs to rights, empowering stakeholders, enhancing governance 
transparency, addressing inequalities, and averting adverse human rights impacts, culminating in a 
framework prioritizing rights fulfillment and fostering equality, justice, and dignity for all (UNFPA, 2023) 
(UNSDG, 2023) (UNSDG, 2003). 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
1. Gender parity scores across 146 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report.
2. Indicators measuring the gender gap in terms of access to electricity and clean cooking, employment and leadership, energy entrepreneurship, and the regulatory environment.

Ideas for infographics:
1. Gender Parity Map: A world map showing the gender parity scores of different countries, with color-coding to indicate the level of gender equality.
2. Gender Gap Indicators: A bar chart or radar chart comparing the gender gap indicators mentioned in the text, highlighting the disparities and trends.

Design recommendations:
1. Gender Parity Map: Use a color gradient to represent the gender parity scores, with darker shades indicating higher gender equality. Include a legend to explain the color-coding.
2. Gender Gap Indicators: Use a bar chart to compare the different indicators, with each bar representing a specific indicator and the length of the bar indicating the level of gender equality. Use different colors for each indicator and provide a clear title and axis labels.

These graphics and infographics would enhance the understanding of the text by visually representing the data and making it easier to identify disparities and trends in gender equality.

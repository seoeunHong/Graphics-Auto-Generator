2.1.4. Portfolio Approach 
What is it? 
This systemic approach 
involves transitioning from 
isolated projects to an 
interconnected network of 
interventions fostering self-
transformation and 
resilience, promoting 
adaptability amid 
uncertainties and risks 
through experiential learning 
How does it work?  
This approach creates 
interconnected interventions 
targeting systemic change. It 
navigates uncertainty by engaging 
in iterative experimentation with 
complex issues. It begins without 
defined outcomes, employs 
discussions with stakeholders to 
embrace uncertainty, and relies 
on teamwork for rapid adaptation 
and management of 
unpredictable risks 
Why apply it? 
This approach facilitates 
evidence-based planning and 
decision-making in systems with 
dense interactions and 
relationships, especially for 
addressing dynamic issues. It 
aims to bolster community 
resilience, champion justice, and 
empower societies to confidently 
confront uncertainty, utilizing 
flexible interventions to 
effectively tackle complex issues.  
 
Frameworks: The "Leave No One Behind" (LNOB) 
The "Leave No One Behind" (LNOB) framework prioritizes marginalized communities in development, 
fostering their participation and addressing discrimination and exclusion. It integrates Human Rights-
based and Gender Mainstreaming strategies, targeting inequalities at intersections of various criteria. 
Its methodology involves identifying excluded groups, prioritizing actions, designing indicators, and 
ensuring accountability. Outcomes include identifying vulnerabilities, crafting targeted policies, 
selecting monitoring indicators, and establishing accountability mechanisms. The framework 
champions rights, exposes inequalities, promotes inclusive processes, and ensures intervention 
accountability for marginalized groups in development initiatives.

The portfolio approach is a dynamic process fostering learning within human systems. It involves creating 
interconnected interventions that actively build community capabilities, relationships, and narratives 
through experiential learning. These portfolios enhance adaptive capacity, fostering systemic change 
known as self-transformation, empowering communities and societies to navigate uncertainties 
confidently. Exploration involves engaging stakeholders, uncovering connections, and building a shared 
vision within the context. Development of Options creates interventions stimulating different aspects of 
human systems and adapts outcomes to new learnings, aiming for self-transformation within the system. 
Ignition for Self-Transformation uses interventions as active learning experiences, building confidence and 
turning learning into policies and cooperation, ultimately building adaptive capabilities within human 
systems (UNDP, 2023) (UNDP, 2022) (UNDP Unstuck website) 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:

1. The number of interconnected interventions in the portfolio approach compared to isolated projects.
2. The process of iterative experimentation and rapid adaptation in the portfolio approach.
3. The outcomes of the portfolio approach, such as evidence-based planning, community resilience, justice, and empowerment.

Ideas for infographics:

1. Infographic on the portfolio approach: This infographic can visually represent the transition from isolated projects to interconnected interventions. It can show a network of interventions connected by lines, with isolated projects on one side and the portfolio approach on the other side. The size of the interventions can represent their impact or scale. The infographic can also include icons or symbols to represent the outcomes of the portfolio approach, such as evidence-based planning, community resilience, justice, and empowerment.

2. Infographic on the "Leave No One Behind" framework: This infographic can visually represent the methodology of the framework, including the steps of identifying excluded groups, prioritizing actions, designing indicators, and ensuring accountability. It can use icons or symbols to represent each step and show the flow of the process. The infographic can also include examples or case studies to illustrate the outcomes of the framework, such as identifying vulnerabilities, crafting targeted policies, selecting monitoring indicators, and establishing accountability mechanisms.

3. Infographic on the process of self-transformation in the portfolio approach: This infographic can visually represent the stages of self-transformation, including exploration, development of options, and ignition for self-transformation. It can use icons or symbols to represent each stage and show the progression from exploration to ignition. The infographic can also include examples or case studies to illustrate how interventions can be used as active learning experiences and how learning can be turned into policies and cooperation.

Design recommendations:

1. Use a clean and modern design with clear and legible fonts.
2. Use a color scheme that is visually appealing and helps convey the message effectively. For example, using warm colors to represent empowerment and cool colors to represent uncertainty.
3. Use icons or symbols that are easily recognizable and represent the concepts accurately.
4. Use arrows or flowcharts to show the progression or flow of processes.
5. Include brief and concise text to explain each step or concept.
6. Use visuals, such as graphs or charts, to represent data points or statistics related to the portfolio approach or the "Leave No One Behind" framework.

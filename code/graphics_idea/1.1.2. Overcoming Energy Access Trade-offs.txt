Balancing Affordability and Sufficiency: Energy sufficiency and affordability pose challenges in 
transitioning to clean energy technologies, potentially leading to a return to polluting energy sources. Off-
grid solutions, with low capacities, might fail to meet surging demand, necessitating a reliance on polluting 
fuels. The lack of reliable energy availability can breed dissatisfaction among users, eroding confidence in 
clean energy sources. A similar dilemma arises in clean cooking: high upfront costs and unreliable LPG 
supply hinder rural communities from abandoning biomass (UCL, 2021). The United Nations Joint 
Programme for Sustainable Charcoal Reduction and Alternative Livelihoods (PROSCAL), implemented an 
integrated approach for the reduction of charcoal consumption in Somalia (Box 5).  
On the contrary, increased access to affordable, reliable energy can inadvertently foster wasteful water 
consumption and overexploitation of resources, known as the "rebound effect". For instance, 
unconventional water supply options such as desalination are highly energy-intensive (ICSU, 2017). This 
phenomenon extends to agricultural practices. Strategies focused on energy sufficiency measures, 
affordability mechanism, and capacity building have shown promise in mitigating these rebound effects 
(WBG, 2017) (WLPGA, 2018).

Box 4: The UN Women-Joint Programme, initiated in Ethiopia in 2011, unites six UN agencies to bolster 
gender equality and women's empowerment. With a focus on all 11 regions, it aligns with Ethiopia's 
development frameworks, aiming to enhance women's income, education, and rights while promoting 
leadership. Supported by Sweden and Norway, the program includes interest-free loans and business 
skill development, creating a revolving fund for women's empowerment. Notably, the initiative has 
enabled women, to invest in an energy-saving cooking stove cooperative, fostering economic 
empowerment within their village and beyond.

The United Nations Joint Program for Sustainable Charcoal Reduction and Alternative 
Livelihoods (PROSCAL) ran from 2016 to 2022 with the objective of reducing unsustainable 
charcoal production, trade, and usage in Somalia. It sought to bolster energy security and 
livelihoods by engaging stakeholders, enforcing trade bans, developing alternative energy, 
transitioning charcoal practices, and promoting reforestation. PROSCAL's interventions aimed 
to create local economic opportunities, diminish poverty, halt environmental degradation, 
improve energy security, foster resilience among vulnerable groups, diversify energy sources, 
mitigate conflict, and promote peace and development. 
 
  
Ensuring Sustainable Batteries Management: Renewable-based energy access solutions, such as solar or 
wind, heavily rely on batteries to overcome natural resources’ intermittence. However, improper 
maintenance and disposal of batteries can lead to severe pollution, impacting human health (SDG 3) and 
ecosystems (SDG 14-15). With millions of these products sold in recent years, effective waste management 
will become increasingly important (Lighting Global, 2022). Stakeholders and companies must prioritize 
robust commitment to proper battery management, covering maintenance, security standards, and 
disposal. E-waste regulation planning is becoming integral to operational plans, fostering innovation and 
strategic partnerships, especially in regions lacking e-waste infrastructure. For example, only a few 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa (including Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa), have e-waste 
management facilities, equipped for off-grid solar value-chain recycling, and cross-boundary movement is 
expensive and complex. The scarcity of e-waste management facilities capable of handling end-of-life 
products from off-grid solar necessitates immediate attention and action (Lighting Global, 2022) (other 
sources). The Global Battery Alliance (Box 6) has emerged to tackle these challenges. In their recent report, 
the Alliance highlights the need for pilot projects aimed at launching and scaling effective corporate 
reverse logistics programs. Additionally, they advocate for establishing traceability and disclosure systems 
to address these critical issues (GBA, 2021). 
  
 
 
 
The Moment of Leaving No One Behind: Remote communities lacking grid access, marked by low 
population density, incomes, challenging terrains, and poor infrastructure, confront significant hurdles in 
accessing electricity. These communities can be grouped into three categories: geographically remote 
regions like rural settings, mountainous areas, small islands, and deep forests; communities with a remote 
chance of gaining grid access, including displaced refugees due to conflict or natural disasters; and those 
fully dependent on off-grid energy with minimal demand profiles, such as Indigenous communities. 
Despite varying characteristics, these settlements share commonalities in low electricity needs, economic 
and energy poverty, and a remote likelihood of obtaining grid-based electricity supply (IRENA, 2023). The 
diverse profile of last-mile communities necessitates community-centric models to ensure tailored 
solutions that fit their unique characteristics and needs. Successful and inclusive projects in the Hindu 
Kush Himalaya region (Box 7) showcase effective approaches addressing the challenges of last-mile regions 
(HIMAP, 2019) (ADB, 2023). 
 
Avoiding Gender Blindness in Energy Access: Social norms and gender roles can hinder women from 
benefiting equally from energy access initiatives, discourage them from participating in the sector’s labor 
force, and impacting their inclusion in decision-making processes. Gender-blind initiatives counteract 
women's equality, worsening gender gaps in energy poverty (SDG Action, 2023). Affordability mechanisms 
that neglect women deepen dependency, as they often receive lower salaries and depend on men's 
income. Low-capacity electricity systems, like small-capacity SHS, can perpetuate women's reliance on 
polluting mechanisms. While clean light intends to enhance work hours, it may burden women with longer 
schedules, reducing rest time.  
Women are particularly vulnerable in conflict, disaster, and emergency settings, with millions forcibly 
displaced, lacking access to modern lighting and facing risks like violence and fuel-related challenges.  
The lack of gender-responsive training for off-grid systems can exclude women, 
hindering initiatives and reinforcing gender inequality.  The enabling environment for 
women's participation in the energy sector requires gender-responsive planning, 
Box 6: The Global Battery Alliance (GBA), initiated at the World Economic Forum in 2017, aims to 
ensure a sustainable battery value chain by 2030 through a collective effort involving international 
organizations, NGOs, industry, academia, and governments. This alliance focuses on Action 
Partnerships, tackling critical areas like establishing global criteria for sustainable batteries, ensuring 
responsible sourcing of materials, and promoting energy access in emerging economies while 
emphasizing circular practices to reduce lead poisoning and environmental impacts. 
Box 7: Through an intervention called “Creating Self Sustainable, Smart and Low Carbon Villages”, the 
Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE) is helping remote Himalayan communities lacking electricity 
access to transform through locally designed, locally implemented and locally maintained solutions. 
Their aim is to bring about holistic change by merging the elements of sustainability, clean cooking, 
digital education, homestay tourism and solar-based electrification. Being connected with a solar grid 
gives villages a future and protects their cultural heritage.

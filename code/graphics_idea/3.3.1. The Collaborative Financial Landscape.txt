3.3.1. The Collaborative Financial Landscape 
Joint SDG Fund: The Joint SDG Fund operates as a multi-partner trust fund supporting broader UN 
functions in a flexible and multilateral-friendly manner. It aims to mobilize $290 million annually for SDG-
focused development programs, having funded 230 joint initiatives across 119 countries and territories. 
With partners including UN Member States, international organizations, the private sector, and 
philanthropists, it has generated over 1,000 partnerships and tested 300+ innovative solutions for the 2030 
Agenda. In 2022, it finalized 35 integrated programs, attracted $2.3 billion in additional financing alongside 
its $258 million commitments, achieving a leverage of over $9 for every $1, fostering an environment for 
SDG-driven policies. This effort prioritizes two outcomes: Accelerating SDG Achievement Through 
Integrated Policies and Amplifying Finance for Transformative Change. A thematic focus on Climate Action 
and Energy Transformation, engaging with UNFCCC and stakeholders, emphasized the implementation of 
climate programs, amounting to $83 million in commitments, positioning the Fund as a COP financing 
solution. 
Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN): The Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) serves as a global 
advocate for impact investing, striving to enhance its global effectiveness. Through collaboration with 
investors, the GIIN facilitates knowledge exchange, promotes innovation, and provides resources to reduce 
barriers to impact investment, directing more capital toward global challenges. Its strategy includes 
networking, alliances, events, impact measurement tools, research initiatives, and market leadership 
programs. Engaging with strategic partners like the Asian Venture Philanthropy Network, the GIIN aims to 
build an ecosystem that fosters impactful investing, contributing to a more equitable and sustainable 
world. 
Partnership Fund for the Sustainable Development Goals: The Partnership Fund for the Sustainable 
Development Goals, led by the World Bank Group, aligns with SDG 17 to bolster global partnerships for 
sustainable development. Established in 2018, it channels seed funding to strategic, high-impact initiatives 
aimed at fostering an enabling environment for investment, innovation, and scalable 
solutions.

SDG Finance in Energy: The Africa Minigrids Program (AMP) 
The Africa Minigrids Program (AMP) operates in 21 African countries, focusing on early-stage minigrid 
markets to enable subsequent large-scale private investments. AMP aims to enhance clean energy 
access by boosting the financial viability of renewable energy minigrids, emphasizing cost reduction 
(hardware, soft, and financing costs) and innovative business models. These efforts intend to lower 
tariffs and expand services for end-users. This multi-partner initiative involves UNDP, the Rocky 
Mountain Institute, and the African Development Bank, funded by GEF. Collaborating with various 
stakeholders, AMP supplements existing efforts in the minigrid space, fostering partnerships and 
cooperation. Launched in 2022, AMP is scheduled to run until 2027.

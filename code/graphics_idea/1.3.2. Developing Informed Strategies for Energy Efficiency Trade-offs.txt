enabling increased efficiency and productivity (SDG 9, 11, 12). Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, 
like real-time analytics, significantly enhance energy efficiency and reduce waste across various channels 
(UNDP, 2018). Developing nations have immense potential to adopt Industry 4.0 in manufacturing, 
employing smart production tools like sensors and Artificial Intelligences (AI) to enhance productivity and 
minimize environmental impact (UN, 2022). Agriculture 4.0 is also emerging for enhanced farming 
practices. Agricultural automation trends include creating specialized equipment for farming tasks and 
converting standard machinery into autonomous systems (FAO, 2020). Smart cities and grids, driven by 
digital tech, optimize urban infrastructure and energy networks. UNDP-supported projects in places like 
Mauritius introduce smart grid solutions that automate responses to outages and improve reliability and 
power quality. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, digital tech monitors and reduces building power consumption, 
critical for emissions reduction. Tracking energy use and emissions in 75% of buildings aids in efficient 
planning and disaster mitigation (Box 15) (UNDP, 2023). 
 
1.3.2. Developing Informed Strategies for Energy Efficiency Trade-offs  
Mitigating Development Degrowth: Mitigating industrial degrowth in developing nations while pursuing 
SDG 7.3 involves a delicate balance. Prioritizing energy efficiency must not impede industrial progress but 
rather encourage sustainable development and industrialization. Concerns arise around the early 
retirement of fossil energy infrastructure, where policies like carbon pricing can aid innovation and 
compliance in the industrial sector (SDG 9) (ICSU, 2017). Implementing energy-from-waste strategies, such 
as fuels produced from domestic waste, requires energy-intensive transportation of waste residues and 
operation of agrofuel processing plants (ICSU, 2017). To avoid trade-offs, an integrated approach across 
the entire value chain is required. Moreover, defining energy efficiency strategies poses challenges due to 
varied definitions and their multifaceted impacts UNESCWA, 2016). While focusing on resource losses, 
efficiency measures need a more comprehensive view, integrating social, environmental, and sustainability 
factors. The nexus approach allows examining productivity in sectors such energy and water production, 
emphasizing decentralized generation and optimizing the entire supply chain, ensuring resource value is 
maximized.  
Scaling Nature-Based Solutions for Addressing Inequality and Land Challenges: Nature-based solutions 
stand as a promising avenue for scaling up energy efficiency. However, the substantial 
land requirements of large-scale nature-based solutions, especially for climate change 
mitigation (i.e. carbon capture solutions), necessitate concurrent measures to alleviate 
Box 16: The UNDP's project in Sri Lanka, spanning 2019 to 2023, targets sustainable energy use in the 
Agro-Industry to cut emissions and boost savings. Focused on solar energy and biogas, the project 
exemplifies a South-South cooperation led by China. It aims to build capacity, transfer technology, and 
apply innovative waste-to-energy solutions, including converting slurry into organic fertilizer. By 
showcasing energy-efficient applications, waste management, and productivity gains, the project 
benefits from China's expertise, fostering capacity development in partner countries. 
 
 
land pressure, such as shifts in food systems and agriculture, to prevent potential conflicts. Inclusive design 
becomes critical considering the historical impact on marginalized communities amid land and climate 
changes. Challenges to wider adoption include limitations in ecosystem services, monitoring difficulties, 
and varying societal perceptions of climate risks (WWF, 2020). Mitigating potential trade-offs and avoiding 
exacerbating climate issues and social injustices require integrated, bottom-up approaches. UNDP's 
initiatives, particularly in tackling deforestation through nature-based solutions, exemplify this 
comprehensive strategy (Box 17). 
 
Closing the Triple Digital Divide in Agriculture 4.0: Despite the promises of increased efficiency through 
digitalization and smart-agriculture innovations (SDG 2 and 9), challenges persist. Issues like data 
management, technology operation, and affordability hinder widespread adoption, particularly among 
small-scale farmers. Innovative approaches like service provision and cooperative ownership offer 
potential solutions to enhance accessibility. UNDP's Africa Minigrids Program utilizes digital innovation to 
scale solar minigrids, ensuring affordability through remote monitoring and real-time consumption 
tracking (Box 18). Agriculture 4.0 heavily relies on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), 
yet access to robust IT infrastructure remains a challenge, especially in rural areas of developing nations 
(FAO, 2020). Engaging youth, and particularly women (SDG 5), in Agriculture 4.0 and green economy 
initiatives presents opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship, but necessitate a gender-
responsive approach to overcome gender gaps in technology access and resource dependency pose 
challenges (UN Women Africa, 2023). To address these disparities, UN Women's study aims to minimize 
the triple divide impacting women and prepare youth for inclusive, environmentally sensitive livelihoods 
through gender-responsive programs integrated into climate-smart agriculture solutions (Box 19). 
Box 17: In Angola, where 88% of the multidimensionally poor reside in rural areas facing threats from 
deforestation and traditional energy usage, the UNDP collaborates with the government to address 
this critical issue. Angola's 2020-2022 development priority emphasizes natural resource management 
for conservation and economic growth. UNDP's approach involves integrated, nature-based solutions 
targeting deforestation and forest degradation. Efforts concentrate on sustainable forest 
management, notably community-based forestry, and enhancing the sustainability of the charcoal 
value chain. This includes promoting sustainable charcoal consumption practices in cities and 
integrating sustainability criteria into government policies, fostering long-term environmental 
preservation and benefiting rural communities. 
 
 
 
 
Sustainability Education for Shaping a Greener Future: Effective achievement of energy efficiency goals 
demands broad cooperation (SDG 17) and necessitates education on sustainability (SDG 12). Creating 
widespread awareness and understanding among governments, industries, and communities is 
paramount for success (WEF, 2023). While technology is essential, influencing consumer behavior 
significantly impacts energy savings. Successful energy efficiency initiatives require a mix of technology-
driven solutions and a deep understanding of human behavior. This emphasizes tailored, cost-effective 
approaches, continual evaluation, and engagement with communication experts in crafting effective 
behavior change campaigns. Behavioral approaches can reshape energy efficiency programs, focusing on 
behavior change and gender equality. These programs need to consider local contexts and consumer data, 
possibly integrating them into broader interventions (ESMAP, 2020). Education on energy efficiency 
encourages the development of technologies that minimize energy wastage and promotes collaborative 
research into renewable and clean energy resources (UNESCO, 2023) Overcoming challenges involves 
inclusive capacity-building efforts across sectors, focusing on individuals regardless of age or gender, 
particularly targeting women and youth (SDG 5) (FAO, 2020). 
 
Box 18: UNDP's Africa Minigrids Program operates in 21 sub-Saharan countries, utilizing digital 
innovation to scale solar minigrids and revolutionize energy markets. This program is specifically aimed 
at early-stage minigrid markets, aiming to create an environment conducive to substantial private 
investment. Its goal is to enhance access to clean energy by bolstering the financial viability and 
encouraging significant commercial investment in renewable energy minigrids across Africa. The 
program focuses on cost-reduction strategies and innovative business models to achieve these 
objectives. 
Box 19: In exploring opportunities for youth in agriculture across Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda, 
UN Women East and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO) emphasizes addressing challenges 
hindering youth engagement, notably gender inequality, limited access to resources, and the digital 
divide. Their report highlights disparities in job access within the agriculture sector, proposing 
comprehensive recommendations. These suggestions span capacity development in digital and 
business skills, quality assurance, intellectual rights protection, soil health, renewable energy, and 
agroecological farming. The focus extends to narrowing the digital divide, promoting gender equality, 
inclusive business models, and investing in tailored technologies for sustainable agriculture. 
Ultimately, these efforts aim to bolster youth opportunities while ensuring gender-inclusive, energy-
efficient, and sustainable growth in the agricultural landscape.

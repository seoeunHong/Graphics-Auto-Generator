What is it? 
An approach that considers 
gender as an analytical variable, 
entailing a shift from gender-
neutral to gender-responsive 
initiatives, policies, actions or 
processes.  
How does it work?  
Gender mainstreaming 
embodies the integration of a 
gender perspective across the 
entire spectrum of planning, 
implementation, monitoring, 
and evaluation within policies, 
programs, and actions spanning 
all sectors and levels 
Why apply it? 
It promotes gender equality by 
identifying 
and 
addressing 
disparities, 
ensuring 
equal 
benefits 
from 
policies 
and 
programs, 
and 
promoting 
inclusivity.

Gender mainstreaming integrates a gender perspective into planning, implementation, monitoring, and 
evaluation across sectors and levels, ensuring women's and men's concerns become integral in initiatives 
to foster equality. Its core aim is to advance gender equality by identifying disparities and ensuring policies 
equally benefit both genders, eradicating discrimination. This methodical approach analyzes policies for 
gender implications, addresses gaps using data, implements gender-responsive actions, and monitors 
progress through sex-disaggregated and gender indicators, incorporating gender perspectives at every 
stage. Throughout the project cycle, from design to evaluation, gender mainstreaming ensures equitable 
program benefits, opposes discriminatory practices, amplifies initiative effectiveness 
through diverse perspectives, and aligns closely with the UN Charter's values of 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        To enhance understanding of the concept of gender mainstreaming, the following data points could benefit from graphical representation:

1. The spectrum of planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation: A visual representation of this spectrum could help illustrate how gender mainstreaming is integrated across different stages of a project or initiative.

2. Sectors and levels: A graphic showing different sectors (e.g., education, health, economy) and levels (e.g., national, regional, local) could demonstrate the wide-ranging application of gender mainstreaming.

3. Disparities and equal benefits: A comparison chart or bar graph could highlight the disparities between genders and how gender mainstreaming aims to ensure equal benefits from policies and programs.

4. Gender-responsive actions: A flowchart or diagram could illustrate the process of identifying gaps and implementing gender-responsive actions.

5. Sex-disaggregated and gender indicators: A visual representation of the types of indicators used to monitor progress could help clarify the distinction between sex-disaggregated and gender indicators.

Infographic ideas:

1. A timeline infographic: This infographic could show the different stages of the project cycle (design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation) and how gender mainstreaming is integrated at each stage. It could also include key actions or strategies used during each stage.

2. A sector-based infographic: This infographic could showcase different sectors (e.g., education, health, economy) and highlight specific examples of gender mainstreaming initiatives or policies within each sector. It could include statistics or case studies to demonstrate the impact of gender mainstreaming.

3. A before-and-after infographic: This infographic could present a comparison of a policy or program before and after gender mainstreaming was applied. It could highlight the changes made, the outcomes achieved, and the benefits for both genders.

Design recommendations:

1. Use clear and concise visuals: Graphics should be visually appealing and easy to understand. Avoid cluttered designs and use colors and icons that are visually appealing and relevant to the topic.

2. Incorporate data: Infographics should include relevant data points to support the information presented. Use charts, graphs, or statistics to convey key messages effectively.

3. Provide context: Infographics should provide a brief explanation or context for each visual element to ensure that readers understand the significance of the data or information being presented.

4. Use a consistent visual style: Maintain a consistent visual style throughout the infographic to create a cohesive and professional look. This includes using the same color scheme, font style, and iconography.

5. Include sources and references: Infographics should include proper citations or references for the data or information presented. This helps establish credibility and allows readers to further explore the topic if desired.

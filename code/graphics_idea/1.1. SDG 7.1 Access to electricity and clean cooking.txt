Despite significant progress in electricity access globally, challenges persist. The COVID-19 and 
complexities in reaching remote areas slowed progress, leaving 733 million without electricity and 2.8 
billion people relying on polluting fuels for cooking in 2020. The majority of these populations live in sub-
Saharan Africa, Asia, especially in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and rural areas. Economic strains due 
to the pandemic hindered access for up to 90 million. If trends continue, an estimated 670 million will lack 
electricity by 2030, with one-fourth of the world's population still lacking clean cooking. Addressing this 
gap requires a major push to assist those living in the least developed areas and in fragile and conflict-
affected countries. The goal of ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy 
services, such as electricity and clean cooking mechanisms, is framed within SDG 7.1. Its 
interconnectedness with various goals (Figure 1) offers synergies to address multiple global challenges, 
amplifying opportunities for education, health, food security and economic development. However, this 
goal necessitates balancing energy sufficiency and affordability, ensuring effective battery management, 
while guaranteeing inclusiveness and gender-responsiveness. The subsequent sections provide a concise 
explanation of these synergies and trade-offs, supported by relevant case studies.   
 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
- Number of people without electricity in 2020 (733 million)
- Number of people relying on polluting fuels for cooking in 2020 (2.8 billion)
- Estimated number of people who will lack electricity by 2030 (670 million)
- Percentage of the world's population lacking clean cooking (one-fourth)

Ideas for infographics:
1. Bar chart: Show the number of people without electricity in 2020 and the estimated number for 2030. This will visually demonstrate the progress made and the projected gap that needs to be addressed.
2. Pie chart: Illustrate the percentage of the world's population lacking clean cooking. This will highlight the scale of the issue and the need for action.
3. Map: Display the regions with the highest number of people without electricity and relying on polluting fuels for cooking. This will provide a visual representation of the areas that require the most attention and resources.

Design recommendations:
- Use clear and contrasting colors to make the data points stand out.
- Include labels and captions to provide context and explanation for the data.
- Use simple and easy-to-understand visuals to ensure accessibility for all audiences.
- Include sources and references for the data to ensure credibility and transparency.

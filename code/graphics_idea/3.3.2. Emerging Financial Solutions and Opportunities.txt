 
 
partnerships—the Fund collaborates with over 400 partners, including UN agencies, private entities, 
academia, and civil society. The Partnership Fund for SDG has supported the implementation of Panama’s 
Energy Transition Agenda by assisting the Government of Panama with the preliminary design of the 
Energy Transition Fund (FTE) and the preparation of a WB guarantee operation to help capitalize the fund. 
 
UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF): The UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), created by the UN 
General Assembly, aids developing nations by offering grants and loans. Focused on Least Developed 
Countries (LDCs), it operates autonomously under the UN Development Programme and collaborates with 
member states and partners. UNCDF targets sustainable growth aligned with global agendas, emphasizing 
partnerships, inclusive finance, and leveraging public-private resources. Its main aim is to assist LDCs facing 
crises and challenges like COVID-19 and climate change, deploying capital strategically across key areas for 
transformative economic growth from 2022-2025. 
Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development (IATF): The Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing 
for Development, comprising over 60 UN agencies, coordinates efforts to implement the Addis Ababa 
Action Agenda. Led by Mr. Li Junhua, it advises on sustainable development financing, providing annual 
reports to ECOSOC. Its mandate includes analyzing global contexts, highlighting synergies within the Addis 
Agenda, and addressing thematic issues, aiming to guide progress and recommend corrective actions at 
national and regional levels. This information is synthetized into Financing for Sustainable Development 
Report. This collaboration among international institutions ensures effective follow-up on financing for 
sustainable development.  
 
3.3.2. Emerging Financial Solutions and Opportunities 
Various innovative financing solutions are emerging to address specific development challenges. (UNDP, 
2018) (G20, 2022) 
Scaling up blended finance and de-risking facilities: Blended finance, including de-risking facilities, 
creatively combines public, private, and philanthropic funds to tackle development challenges. It leverages 
public resources to attract private investment, maximizing impact. By mitigating risk for private investors, 
it encourages their involvement in projects that might not have been feasible otherwise. This approach 
aligns diverse interests and capitalizes on the strengths of various sectors to achieve 
sustainable development goals. Blending practices vary across institutions, including 
the use of concessional and non-concessional public finance from MDBs, other 
Design Support for the Energy Transition Fund in Panama: Led by Panama's National Secretariat of 
Energy (SNE), the FTE will drive action plans for the country's energy transition. Additionally, this 
initiative fosters international experience in fund design and capacity-building in SNE, with plans for 
replication in Central America, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic. Notably, 
the FTE will focus on solar systems for subsidized households and credit lines for solar systems and 
efficient equipment in non-subsidized homes, enabling preferential loans for installing solar panels 
and energy-efficient appliances. 
 
 
Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and development aid programs, and to a lesser extent, donors 
and other third parties. A key benefit of blended finance mechanisms, as opposed to purely public finance, 
is that it crowds in private capital and can expand the total amount of sustainable finance available and 
thereby improve the affordability and accessibility of sustainable finance. It can also operate as a 
mechanism to create sustainable markets by being the initial finance that allows a market or sector to 
develop. 
Developing and deploying digital technologies: The utilization of digital technologies presents a 
transformative opportunity in sustainable finance and inclusive development. These technologies 
significantly reduce the expenses related to data collection, assessment, and reporting, enabling the 
identification of sustainable assets and the disclosure of crucial ESG information. However, challenges 
persist, especially for sectors like agriculture and tourism in developing economies, where data collection 
remains costly. Emerging technologies hold promise in easing this burden, particularly for SMEs, 
potentially granting them easier access to sustainable finance. Additionally, financial technologies like 
mobile payment systems have notably expanded financial services, particularly benefiting rural 
populations globally. Recently, digital tools have been instrumental in gathering granular ESG data, 
implementing Sustainable Supply Chain Financing (including Fintech tools such as digital platforms and 
blockchain-based technologies), and managing sustainable assets. 
Impact Investing: Impact investing aligns financial goals with social and environmental impact. Investors 
actively seek opportunities that generate positive, measurable outcomes alongside financial returns. This 
approach drives capital towards businesses and projects that address pressing social and environmental 
challenges, ensuring a more sustainable and equitable future. Impact investing is a burgeoning solution, 
combining social and environmental impact with financial returns globally. Key aspects involve intentional 
positive impact, expected financial returns, and diverse return rates across various assets. Robust impact 
measurement is pivotal for transparency. It offers opportunities for investors to support societal causes 
while gaining financial returns. Various entities, from financial institutions to governments, leverage it for 
diverse reasons, attracting a broad spectrum of investors. Financial performance varies, with some seeking 
below-market returns aligned with goals, while others aim for competitive, market-rate returns. A handful 
of impact investors have begun to create products, raise capital, and make new investments that directly 
target progress toward the SDGs. Going beyond aligning and retroactively mapping impact to the SDGs, 
these investors proactively target and incorporate the goals at various stages of the investment cycle, thus 
making them the central focus.

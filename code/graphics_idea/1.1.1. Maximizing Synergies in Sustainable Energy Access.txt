Enlightening Education: Well-lit, heated, and cooled schools and households create comfortable and 
effective learning spaces for children and adults (SDG 4). Illumination extends education opportunities into 
evening classes, catering to diverse schedules. Modern information and communication technologies (SDG 
9), powered through electricity access, significantly enhance learning experiences and foster digital 
literacy. Access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy in schools significantly improves education 
quality and accessibility. Furthermore, access to the Internet supports digital connectivity of rural schools, 
which during COVID-19 has been key for educational resilience (ICSU, 2017). Access to quality education 
results in enhanced educational attainment and high completion rates, providing lifelong benefits to 
children.  
Enhancing Health Services and Water Access through Electricity: Access to reliable electricity is 
fundamental for health services (SDG 3), safe childbirth, vaccinations, diagnostics, and emergency 
response (WHO, 2023). Nearly 1 billion people in low- and lower-middle-income countries lack reliable 
electricity in healthcare facilities (WHO, 2023). Electricity enables rural populations to store and refrigerate 
medicines and vaccines, ensuring community health. It powers vital medical devices, lighting and 
communications. Electricity is also key for improving household health conditions, through clean indoor 
environments, cooking facilities, and thermal comfort (heating and cooling).  Energy also contributes to 
expanding water and sanitation services (SDG 6), particularly in water-stressed regions. Decentralized solar 
PV water pumps can replace more expensive diesel pumps and mini-grids can power filtration 
technologies, such as reverse osmosis systems, to produce clean drinking water (IEA, 2023), powering a 
shift toward unconventional water supply options (e.g. desalination). In schools, energy can power 
refrigeration and access to water and sanitation, essential for children’s health and safe nutrition. For 
instance, Solar PV systems and solar pumps installed by UNICEF (Box 1) have been used successfully in 
educational facilities to provide better access to safe water and hygienic sanitation.  
 
Leveraging Electricity for Food Security and Productive Development: Providing affordable, reliable, and 
modern energy services to the world's poor aligns with poverty eradication and reducing inequalities (SDG 
1 and 10). In rural areas, where many lack energy access, empowering impoverished farmers with energy 
facilitates groundwater pumping, mechanization of farming, and maintenance of temperature-controlled 
supply chains. This enhances food crop yields, diversifies regional diets, and contributes to income 
generation (SDG2 and SDG 8). The World Bank projects that by 2030, two-thirds of the 
world’s extreme poor will live in fragile, conflict and violence settings. As a result, 
Box 1: In 2019, The UNICEF’s Solar-powered water systems program installed more than 1,200 solar-
powered water systems in over 40 countries across six regions, providing water to the most vulnerable 
children and their families in remote areas. The initiative deployed renewable energy access solutions 
prioritizing public service facilities such as health facilities, schools, and community centers. In Nigeria, 
371 systems helped provide water and power to 52 schools and 85 health-care facilities, and large-
scale solar-powered systems were implemented in Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen in 
emergency contexts.  
 
 
 
achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 10 (Reduce Inequalities) demands innovative solutions. The 
adoption of solar-powered irrigation systems in Yemen is an example of an innovative and conflict-resilient 
practice that has safeguarded food production capacities (Box 2). 
 
Energizing Gender Equality: Household air pollution causes around 13 deaths per minute, mostly affecting 
women and girls who shoulder household responsibilities and face exposure to polluting lighting and 
cooking methods (SDG 3 and 5) (ICSU, 2017). Women and girls, spending up to 18 hours weekly on wood 
gathering and household cooking. (UNDP, 2022). Therefore, access to clean energy directly aids in reducing 
women's time poverty, for instance thanks to equipment such as fridges and washing machines, allowing 
better educational attendance.  
Furthermore, access to energy is a key enabler for broadening opportunities for women. Studies indicate 
a 9 to 23% increase in women's employment post-electrification (UN, 2022). Public outdoor lighting 
increases security for women and girls, allowing more autonomy after dark and reducing exposure to 
gender-based violence. 
  
Information technologies and the Internet reduce the digital divide and foster digital inclusion for women 
and girls (WEF, 2023) (ITU, 2020). Empowered women are more likely to drive local initiatives benefiting 
from cleaner cooking and lighting, which directly impacts their lives.  
UNDP’s integrated projects in India and Nepal have shown promising results toward energy access, 
women’s equality and productive opportunities development (Box 3). UN Women's efforts in Ethiopia, 
included interest-free loans and entrepreneurship training benefiting over 19,500 women, enabling them 
to invest in an energy-saving cooking stove cooperative (Box 4). 
 
Box 2: Between 2018 and 2022, the Yemen Emergency Electricity Access Project (YEEAP) spearheaded 
the expansion of electricity access in rural and peri-urban areas through solar solutions. This World 
Bank-funded initiative, executed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) alongside 
local entities, empowered six microfinance institutions to introduce financing products for small-scale 
energy systems. Over 3.2 million people, notably 51% female, accessed critical services like water, 
education, and healthcare, including support for COVID-19, through solar-powered facilities. 
Box 3: UNDP's energy access projects have significantly bolstered livelihoods, particularly for women, 
increasing income potential by up to 2.5 times. In India's Jharkhand State, solar stations facilitated by 
the UNDP have empowered women-run micro-enterprises, enabling them to produce essential 
hygiene products while earning an income. Similarly, in Nepal's Solta Bazaar, a solar minigrid 
supported a health lab and an IT training center, providing crucial services and education, sparing 
women long journeys for medical care.

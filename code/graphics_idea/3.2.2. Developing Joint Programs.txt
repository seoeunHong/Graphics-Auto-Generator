The Guidance Note on a New Generation of Joint Programs, developed by the The United Nations 
Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), is intended to make joint programs (JP) more effective, 
catalytic, and easier to use. It responds to guidance and decisions by members states, lessons from 
experience, and needs identified by UN Country Teams. The guidance aims to enhance Joint Programs 
(JPs) within the Cooperation Framework, emphasizing key aspects like catalyzing policy changes, 
government ownership, aligned roles and responsibilities, quality standards, and joint management for 
results. It introduces options for flexible JP design and non-UN partner involvement, aiming to improve 
effectiveness and attract increased donor investment in support of the SDGs across all UN funds, programs, 
and specialized agencies. 
 
A joint program is a strategic collaboration between two or more UN organizations and partners aimed at 
achieving significant development outcomes. It leverages the strengths of participating entities to deliver 
results aligned with country priorities, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and Cooperation 
Framework objectives. These programs focus on policy changes that can drive systemic impact and may 
operate at country, regional, or global levels, involving multiple regions or countries. To implement a JP, 
key steps involve verifying its suitability, defining responsibilities across the JP cycle stages (Design, 
Implement & Adjust, Learn, Transition, and Close), and ensuring adherence to standard program cycles 
and quality standards aligned with the Cooperation Framework. 
United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework: The 2030 Agenda emphasizes a 
responsive UN development system, encapsulated in the new Internal Guidance for the UN 
Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. These frameworks focus on four key objectives: 
aligning responses to national priorities for SDG achievement, fostering diverse partnerships across 
sectors and stakeholders, ensuring no one is left behind, and tailoring approaches to each Member 
State's needs. The Cooperation Framework now guides the entire program cycle, driving planning, 
implementation, monitoring, reporting and evaluation of collective UN support for achieving the 2030 
Agenda. By emphasizing inclusivity, partnerships, and tailored responses, these frameworks aim to 
drive concrete actions on the ground, leveraging the UN system's collective capabilities to realize the 
2030 Agenda globally. 
 
  
 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
- Number of joint programs developed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG)
- Number of UN organizations and partners involved in joint programs
- Number of countries or regions covered by joint programs
- Amount of donor investment in support of the SDGs across all UN funds, programs, and specialized agencies

Ideas for infographics:
1. Joint Programs by Region: A map showing the regions or countries where joint programs are being implemented, with different colors or icons representing the number of programs in each region.
2. UN Organizations and Partners in Joint Programs: A visual representation of the different UN organizations and partners involved in joint programs, with their logos or names displayed in a diagram or network.
3. Donor Investment in Joint Programs: A bar chart or pie chart showing the amount of donor investment in support of the SDGs across all UN funds, programs, and specialized agencies, highlighting the top donors.

Design recommendations:
- Use clear and concise labels for the data points in the graphics.
- Choose colors that are visually appealing and easy to distinguish.
- Include a title or caption that clearly explains the information being presented.
- Use simple and intuitive icons or symbols to represent different entities or regions.
- Ensure that the graphics are visually balanced and not overcrowded with information.
- Provide a key or legend to explain any symbols or colors used in the graphics.

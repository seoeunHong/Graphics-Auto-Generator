Energy is one of the main contributors to climate change, accounting for 73% of human-caused 
greenhouse gases. The developing world, particularly Africa with its carbon emissions accounting for less 
than three percent of global energy-related emissions, will bear the brunt of climate change impacts. 
Renewable energy use rose to 17.7 % in 2019, notably in electricity generation, hitting 26.2 %. Investment 
costs for small-scale renewable energy technologies (e.g., Solar Home Systems) dropped considerably in 
recent years, making these solutions competitive and signaling wider profitability ahead (ICSU, 2017). 
Some of the poorer regions of the world possess high-quality renewable resources (e.g. biomass and solar 
power in Africa), offering potential for poverty alleviation if leveraged effectively (ICSU, 2017). However, 
progress needs acceleration, especially in heating and transport sectors. Effective climate action demands 
bolstering policy support across all sectors and enhancing tools to mobilize private capital (UN-Habitat, 
2022). Increasing renewable energy adoption aligns with SDG 7.2 and interconnects with multiple goals, 
offering solutions to various global challenges while providing opportunities for health, jobs, and gender 
equality. They also mitigate climate change impact and improve cities and 
communitiesâ€™ resilience. However, renewable energy initiatives should place particular 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        emphasis on gender equality and women's empowerment. Women often face barriers to accessing and benefiting from renewable energy solutions, such as limited access to finance, lack of technical skills, and gender norms that restrict their participation in decision-making processes. By addressing these barriers and ensuring women's inclusion in renewable energy initiatives, we can maximize the social, economic, and environmental benefits of these solutions.

To enhance understanding of the data presented in the passage, the following graphical representations and infographics could be created:

1. Sankey Chart: Create a Sankey chart to visually represent the synergies and trade-offs between SDG 7.2 (Renewable Energy) and other SDGs. This chart can show how renewable energy initiatives contribute to various goals, such as climate action, poverty alleviation, gender equality, and resilient cities and communities. The chart should clearly label each SDG and show the flow of benefits and impacts between them.

2. Bar Chart: Create a bar chart to compare the percentage of renewable energy use in different regions or countries. This chart can highlight the progress made in increasing renewable energy adoption and identify regions or countries that need to accelerate their efforts. The bars should be color-coded to differentiate between different types of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, biomass).

3. Pie Chart: Create a pie chart to illustrate the breakdown of greenhouse gas emissions by sector, with a specific focus on the energy sector. This chart can visually demonstrate the significant contribution of the energy sector to climate change and emphasize the need for renewable energy solutions to mitigate these emissions. The pie chart should clearly label each sector and show the percentage of emissions attributed to each.

4. Infographic: Create an infographic that highlights the barriers women face in accessing and benefiting from renewable energy solutions. This infographic can include statistics on the gender gap in energy access, the impact of gender norms on women's participation, and the benefits of women's inclusion in renewable energy initiatives. It should use visually appealing icons, illustrations, and concise text to convey the information effectively.

5. Infographic: Create an infographic that showcases successful examples of renewable energy initiatives that prioritize gender equality and women's empowerment. This infographic can feature case studies from different regions or countries, highlighting the positive outcomes of including women in decision-making processes, providing training and skills development opportunities, and ensuring equal access to financing. It should use before-and-after visuals, quotes from beneficiaries, and key statistics to demonstrate the impact of these initiatives.

Overall, these graphical representations and infographics will enhance the presentation of the text by visually conveying key data points, illustrating the interconnections between SDGs, and highlighting the importance of gender equality in renewable energy initiatives. They should be designed with clear labeling, visually appealing colors and icons, and concise yet informative text to effectively communicate the information to the audience.

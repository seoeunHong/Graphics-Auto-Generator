UNDP Sustainable Energy Hub 
Module 3: Energy and Sustainable Development Nexus 
Module overview: The urgency to address climate change and achieve the 2030 agenda, coupled with the 
complexity and interconnectedness of today's global landscape, demands integrated approaches. Global 
patterns and emerging insights highlight the power of SDG combinations in accelerating progress amidst 
multifaceted development challenges (SDG Push). Integrated development solutions are required, 
leveraging synergies and mitigating trade-offs to enhance structural transformations, building resilience 
while leaving no one behind. However, solutions are not one-size-fits-all; they demand tailored approaches 
aligned with national priorities. This module aims to empower participants as change-makers and leaders 
in innovative sustainable development solutions, fostering multiple SDG achievements within energy 
initiatives. It explores intricate interlinkages between sustainable energy and various SDGs, offering 
methodological approaches and implementation strategies. Chapter 1 elucidates the complex relationship 
between energy access and clean cooking (SDG 7.1), renewable energy (SDG 7.2) and energy efficiency 
(SDG 7.3) and other SDGs. Chapter 2 delves into tools, approaches, and methods for strategic innovation, 
enabling integrated solutions for multiple challenges. Chapter 3 presents a roadmap for development 
financing, focusing on the role of partnerships and collaboration in fostering these integrated development 
solutions.  
Module Learning Objectives:  
• 
Learners will gain a comprehensive understanding of how sustainable energy intertwines with 
other SDGs, exploring opportunities and navigating challenges to create impactful solutions 
through synergies and trade-offs. 
• 
Participants will develop a robust foundation in key approaches, methodologies, and tools across 
the sustainable energy initiative cycle, reinforcing systemic strategies to operationalize the 
achievement of multiple SDGs. 
• 
Attendees will explore the evolving landscape of partnerships and financial structures for SDG 
interlinkage, uncovering actionable strategies to drive change by fostering collaboration and 
leveraging innovative financing mechanisms. 
• 
Enrollees will engage with real-world case studies and practical applications, revealing the 
transformative potential of systemic change, and gaining insights into sustainable and holistic 
development strategies involving collaboration and partnerships.  
• 
Participants will cultivate critical thinking, operationalize innovative methods, and leverage 
newfound knowledge in partnerships and collaboration, propelling them to lead strategic 
innovations and emerge as impactful change-makers toward sustainable energy and multiple 
signature solutions

        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
- The interlinkages between energy and other SDGs (Chapter 1)
- Approaches, methods, and tools for strategic innovation (Chapter 2)
- Partnership and collaboration for development financing (Chapter 3)

Ideas for infographics:
1. Interlinkages between Energy and other SDGs:
   - Design a network diagram showing the connections between SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and other SDGs, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). The diagram should highlight the specific ways in which energy access, clean cooking, renewable energy, and energy efficiency contribute to the achievement of these other goals.
   
2. Approaches, Methods, and Tools for Strategic Innovation:
   - Create a visual matrix that categorizes the different approaches, methods, and tools mentioned in Chapter 2. Each category should be represented by a different color, and the matrix should provide a brief description of each approach, method, or tool. This will help learners understand the range of options available for strategic innovation in sustainable energy initiatives.
   
3. Partnership and Collaboration for Development Financing:
   - Develop a flowchart illustrating the process of establishing effective partnerships and collaboration for development financing. The flowchart should include steps such as identifying potential partners, building and managing partnerships, and exploring financial mechanisms. This will provide a visual guide for participants to navigate the complexities of partnership and collaboration in the context of sustainable energy and integrated SDGs.

Design recommendations:
- Use clear and concise labels and captions to ensure that the information is easily understandable.
- Utilize colors and icons to differentiate between different SDGs, approaches, methods, and tools.
- Include relevant statistics or data points to support the information presented in the text.
- Use a consistent and visually appealing layout throughout the infographics to maintain coherence and readability.
- Consider using charts or graphs to visualize quantitative data, such as the percentage of the population with access to electricity or the growth of renewable energy capacity over time.
- Incorporate real-world case studies or examples to demonstrate the practical applications of the concepts discussed in the module.

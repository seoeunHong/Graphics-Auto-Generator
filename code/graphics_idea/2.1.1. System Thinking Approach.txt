This section introduces a range of approaches aimed at enhancing the comprehensive understanding of 
interconnected SDGs while operationalizing actions toward achieving multiple goals. These approaches 
serve as overarching strategies used to address complex problems, offering broad guidance on how to 
approach multifaceted issues. Specifically, it explores four complementary approaches within Sustainable 
Energy Initiatives. These include the System Thinking approach, aiding in understanding issues as 
interconnected systems; Gender Mainstreaming, which incorporates gender as an analytical variable, 
involving gender-responsive initiatives, policies, and actions; the Human Rights-Based Approach, 
emphasizing the fulfillment of human rights; and the Portfolio Approach, transitioning from isolated 
projects to an interconnected network through experiential learning. 
2.1.1. System Thinking Approach 
What is it? 
An approach that views 
issues 
as 
interconnected 
systems rather than isolated 
parts.  
How does it work?  
It considers the relationships 
and feedback loops between 
various components within a 
system, 
examining 
how 
different parts interact and 
influence each other.  
Why apply it? 
It provides a holistic view of complex 
issues, identifies underlying causes, 
targets leverage points for effective 
interventions, 
and 
facilitates 
stakeholder 
identification 
and 
engagement. 
SDG Acceleration Toolkit:  
The SDG Acceleration Toolkit is a compendium of tools for analysing system interconnections, 
enhancing policy coherence, ensuring that no one is left behind, identifying risks and building 
resilience. Originally launched in 2017 by the United Nations Sustainable Development Group 
(UNSDG), this refreshed version of the Toolkit is designed to provide UN Country Teams, policy experts 
and Governments with access to existing tools for accelerating progress toward the 2030 Agenda. The 
tools can also support immediate socio-economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as 
effective recovery planning and implementation. The Toolkit is managed jointly by UNICEF and UNDP 
under the auspices of the UNSDG Task Team on Integrated Policy Support.

(UNESCAP, 2020) 
Systems thinking perceives issues as intricate systems rather than isolated elements, exploring 
interconnections and feedback loops among components. It aims to understand complex systems 
comprehensively, identifying stakeholders and their roles, uncovering root causes, pinpointing leverage 
points for impactful changes, and revealing interdependencies. It empowers policymakers to devise 
effective interventions by grasping driving forces within systems. Implementation involves recognizing 
boundaries, mapping interconnectedness, and using tools like system dynamics or causal loop diagrams. 
This approach requires a shift from viewing problems as isolated incidents to systemic constructs. 
Beneficial across the project cycle, especially in early stages for understanding complexity and during 
implementation for dynamic intervention adjustments, systems thinking offers a holistic view, addressing 
underlying causes and facilitating stakeholder engagement inclusively (UNSSC, 2020) (UNESCAP, 2015) 
(UNFCCC, 2015) (UNU-FLORES, 2015. 
 

        
        Graphic Ideas:

        Data points that would benefit from graphical representation:
1. The four complementary approaches within Sustainable Energy Initiatives (System Thinking, Gender Mainstreaming, Human Rights-Based Approach, and Portfolio Approach) could be represented in a visual diagram or infographic to show how they are interconnected and work together.
2. The 10-step participatory Systems Thinking Approach could be represented in a flowchart or step-by-step infographic to provide a visual guide for understanding and implementing the approach.

Ideas for infographics:
1. Infographic on the four complementary approaches within Sustainable Energy Initiatives: This infographic could use a circular diagram to show the four approaches as interconnected elements, with arrows indicating how they support and complement each other. Each approach could be represented with a brief description and key examples of initiatives, policies, and actions associated with it.
2. Infographic on the 10-step participatory Systems Thinking Approach: This infographic could use a linear flowchart design to visually represent the 10 steps of the approach. Each step could be accompanied by a brief description and key activities or tools involved. The infographic could also include icons or illustrations to make it visually engaging and easy to follow.

Design recommendations:
1. Use a color scheme that is visually appealing and consistent with the overall theme of sustainable development.
2. Incorporate icons or illustrations to represent each approach or step, making the infographic more visually engaging and easier to understand.
3. Use clear and concise language to explain each approach or step, avoiding jargon and technical terms as much as possible.
4. Include relevant statistics or examples to highlight the impact and effectiveness of each approach or step.
5. Use a clean and organized layout to ensure that the information is presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner.
6. Consider using a combination of text, visuals, and diagrams to convey information effectively and cater to different learning styles.

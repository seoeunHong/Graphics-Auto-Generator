implementation, resource mobilization, advocacy, policy development, lobbying, and market-based 
operations (IRENA, 2023). Partnerships are fundamental for catalyzing Sustainable Energy investment. The 
global sustainable development landscape's divergence necessitates immediate action to bridge the 
finance gap. Recent global crises expedite calls for reform in the international financial structure, urging 
rapid institutional change. Seizing this opportunity necessitates concerted efforts, emphasizing increased 
development cooperation, SDG investments, and fortified global financial architecture (DESA, 2023).  This 
chapter explores the Global Landscapes of Partnership and Financing for Sustainable Energy and SDGs 
interlinkages, offering strategies to leverage new collaborations and scale-up financing 
 
3.1. Partnership Ecosystems for Sustainable Energy and Integrated SDGs    
UN-Energy, established by the UN System Chief Executives Board, is the United Nations’ mechanism for 
inter-agency collaboration on energy issues, aligning efforts to meet SDG 7 and support the 2030 Agenda 
and Paris Agreement. With 30 leading organizations globally and involvement in over 190 countries, it aims 
to promote coordinated policy development, implementation, and knowledge sharing (Figure 10).

A Global Roadmap for SDG 7 Action was developed following the UN Secretary-General's Dialogue on 
Energy, prioritizing energy access, decarbonization, finance, inclusivity, and innovation. This Roadmap will 
be achieved through over 200 Energy Compacts, translating commitments into concrete actions and 
partnerships. UN-Energy pledges to accelerate action through collaborative efforts, expanded 
partnerships, global campaigns, greener operations, forums, and tracking progress. Leveraging multi-
stakeholder coalitions and bolstered capacity, UN-Energy aims to harness energy's potential for global 
sustainable development.  
The Energy Compact Action Network by UN-Energy bolsters momentum, welcomes new stakeholders, 
fosters coalition-building, and drives continuous ambition and action, catalyzing necessary finance and 
investment. UN-Energy supports collective scaling through joint programs, amplifying UN collaboration, 
and Member State engagement. These programs focus on bridging the energy access gap, ensuring 
inclusive transitions, and integrating energy across sectors to achieve the SDGs. The urgent need for 
integrated approaches optimizing energy's impact on various sectors, ensuring equity in global energy 
transformation, and prioritizing gender inclusion calls for immediate action. 
Strengthening inter-agency cooperation and leveraging data and digitalization for monitoring and 
communication of results remain central to their approach. Tracking progress through dynamic online 
platforms and indicators developed by advisory bodies ensures transparent and accountable reporting 
toward the milestones outlined in the Global Roadmap for SDGs. UN-Energy will compile a dynamic 
overview towards the milestones of the Global Roadmap, building on existing tools for tracking and 
monitoring, including Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report, the work of the SDG7 Technical 
Advisory Group (SDG7-TAG) and other relevant efforts. This will include establishing a dynamic online 
platform through which it will regularly provide updates on progress and activities undertaken. For 
instance, the SDG7-TAG advisory body developed a set of indicators for addressing Energy’s Interlinkages 
(SDGs UN, 2022).  
 
 
This section delves into the global landscape of multi-stakeholder alliances and platforms. It begins by 
introducing relevant compacts, coalitions, alliances, hubs, and public-private partnerships. It then 
highlights significant joint programs and inter-agency initiatives before concluding with key multi-
stakeholder knowledge and data platforms. 
 
SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group (SDG7-TAG): The SDG7-TAG stands as a multi-stakeholder coalition 
encompassing governments, UN agencies, civil society, the private sector, and diverse stakeholders, 
operating under the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This group essentially serves as a 
collaborative body advising on strategies, analyses, and actions to accelerate progress towards 
achieving SDG7 and its interconnected goals. Through inclusive processes, policy briefs, and strategic 
recommendations, the SDG7-TAG aims to enhance the High-Level Political Forum's effectiveness, 
fostering partnerships and actions, providing analytical insights, overseeing the annual SDG7 Energy 
Tracking report, and advising on coordination efforts.

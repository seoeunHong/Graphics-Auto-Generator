Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a systematic method assessing the environmental impacts of a product or 
service throughout its life cycle, considering stages from extraction to disposal. It evaluates resource use, 
emissions, and social implications, aiding sustainability across SDGs. LCA informs decision-making, 
identifies improvement areas, and promotes sustainable practices. Its implementation involves defining 
goals, conducting inventory, assessing impacts, and interpreting results using specific tools. Integrated in 
early project stages, LCA guides design and development, ensuring environmental considerations from the 
start. The advantages include providing a holistic view, enabling informed decisions, identifying 
improvement areas, promoting sustainability, and allowing comparative analysis between options (RIT, 
2020) (NREL, 2023) (UNEP, 2023) (Life Cycle Initiative, 2023). 
Tools: SDG Climate Action Nexus Tool; UNESCWA WEF Regional Policy Toolkit 
Indicators: Water-Energy-and-Food-Security-Nexus Indicator 
 
 
Tool: UNESCWA Input-Output Analysis for Nexus Assessment 
Input-output analysis links economic, social, and environmental aspects of trade and 
investment, revealing resource usage impacts across production chains to final consumers. 
UNESCWA employs a modelling approach to estimate interlinkages among sustainable 
development goals, using a production function akin to input-output systems. The method 
yields interlinkage matrices, aiding the assessment of external variables' impact. Its 
advantages include the swift development of econometric models encompassing numerous 
indicators and data. 
 
Tool: International Science Councilâ€™s Tool for Mapping Nexus 
This guide visually analyzes SDG interactions, using a seven-point scale to quantify synergies 
and conflicts among goals and targets. Scores range from +3 (strong reinforcement) to -3 
(conflict). Key dimensions like time, geography, governance, technology, and directionality 
define these interactions. The method generates an interaction matrix, visualized to assess 
how goals like Zero Hunger, Good Health, Affordable Clean Energy, and Life Below Water 
interact with others.

planet. The right efficiency policies could enable the world to achieve more than 40% of the emissions cuts 
needed to reach climate goals without new technologies. To meet the Goal 7 and compensate for lost 
time, necessitates a yearly average improvement in energy intensity of 3.2 % until 2030. Framed within 
SDG 7.3, this global energy efficiency target requires significant reductions in energy consumption, 
presenting both synergies and trade-offs on global and local scales (Figure 3). Energy efficiency presents 
synergistic opportunities of reducing planetary impacts and promoting sustainable societies, managing 
the water-food-energy nexus, improving waste-to-energy strategies and leveraging digitalization. Yet, 
adopting these measures faces challenges: managing industrial degrowth complexities, scaling nature-
based solutions for inequality and land challenges, and closing the triple digital divide in smart agriculture. 
Achieving energy efficiency requires a shift in behavioral paradigms, reliant on sustainability education and 
enhanced cooperation. The subsequent sections offer concise insights into these synergies and trade-offs, 
complemented by relevant case studies for illustration. 
 
1.3.1. Catalyzing Sustainability through Energy Efficiency 
Building Sustainable Societies through Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency is key to reducing several 
adverse effects of the two previous SDG 7.1 and SDG 7.2. On the one hand, energy efficiency measures 
can avoid the rebound effect of energy access. For instance, an integrated solution developed by the ICLEI 
organization enhanced to improve water and energy efficiency of health centers and maternity centers, 
addressing together several SDG such as 3, 5, 6 and 7 (Box 14), enhancing a more positive impact of energy 
access interventions. On the other side, since energy efficiency reduces the amount of energy 
consumption, it has direct impacts on reducing energy-related environmental effects on climate (SDG 13). 
The Green Economic Development Project developed by the UNDP in Bosnia Herzegovina enhanced saving 
700,000 USD annually, reducing emissions of 2.200 tons of CO2 annually and creating jobs for 664 persons 
/ month (SDG 8) (Box 15), contributing to sustainable cities, climate, education and energy goals.  Nature-
based solutions are gaining traction, counteracting heat waves and high temperatures in urban settings. 
By incorporating elements like blue infrastructure and green roofs, these approaches reduce energy 
consumption and enhance urban microclimates (SDG 11) (WB, 2023)  
 
 
Box 14: In Rwanda, the Urban-LEDS II pilot projects in Muhanga District and Kigali are transforming 
healthcare by upgrading the Gitarama and Gahanga Health Centers. These initiatives introduce cost-
effective and sustainable systems, including rainwater harvesting tanks and energy-efficient lighting 
solutions such as solar-powered streetlights and high-pressure solar water heaters. These upgrades 
aim to reduce operational costs, enhance climate resilience post-COVID-19, and are backed by 
partnerships with ICLEI, a global network for sustainable urban development. This pilot project is 
strengthening Rwanda's innovative, eco-friendly healthcare solutions for a greener future. 
 
 
 
 
Optimizing the Water-Food-Energy Nexus for Sustainability: The growing demand for water (SDG 6), food 
(SDG 2), and energy (SDG 7) exerts immense pressure on this interconnected nexus. For instance, shifting 
dietary patterns towards water-intensive foods, coupled with an anticipated population surge to over 9 
billion by 2050, necessitates a staggering 50% increase in global food production. Agriculture, a major 
consumer of freshwater resources, accounts for nearly 30% of global energy consumption. Integrated and 
efficient management of water, food, and energy presents synergistic opportunities to address these 
multiple challenges. Optimizing power plant operations, deploying advanced cooling systems, and 
embracing energy-efficient irrigation present viable solutions. Water services, acting as a cornerstone for 
demand-side energy management, offer opportunities for power generation and storage, with irrigation 
adjustments during low electricity demand periods and reduced pumping during peaks (IEA, 2023). The 
intertwined nature of land, soil, and water systems calls for comprehensive efficiency measures across the 
agri-food chain. Precision irrigation guided by water providers' data and the safeguarding of ecosystems 
alongside agricultural and energy production are novel solutions to ensure environmental sustainability 
(UN Water, 2023). Efficient cold chain solutions are also key for supporting food security while reducing 
food waste (FAO, 2021).    
Waste-to-Energy Solutions: Waste-based energy generation not only serves as an energy-efficient solution 
but also aligns with multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Connecting SDG 7.2 and 7.3, it 
contributes to low-impact energy generation while addressing waste reduction, resource efficiency, 
fostering innovation, and building resilient infrastructure (SDG 9, 11 and 12). Certain bioenergy forms, 
derived from domestic waste, avert competition with food production (ICSU, 2017). Technological 
advancements, particularly in wastewater management, offer synergistic opportunities. The energy latent 
in wastewater alone can satisfy over half of a treatment plant's electricity needs (IEA, 2023). Implementing 
energy-efficient technologies reshapes consumption patterns, fostering responsible consumption and 
production while minimizing waste-associated energy consumption (ICSU, 2017). The IRENA report 
underscores the potential of agricultural residue-based bioenergy in Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan African 
and South America (IRENA, 2023). UNDPâ€™s project in Sri Lanka promoted the use of bioenergy as a waste 
management strategy within the agro-industry (Box 16). 
Box 15: The Green Economic Development Project developed by the UNDP from 2012 to 2022 has 
improved the energy efficiency of public buildings in Bosnia and Herzegovina for climate comfort. It 
has promoted fuel switch projects, automated energy consumption regulation and management of 
public-sector buildings, and implemented efficient public lighting. Education and capacity-building on 
energy management of public-sector buildings for end-users have also been provided.

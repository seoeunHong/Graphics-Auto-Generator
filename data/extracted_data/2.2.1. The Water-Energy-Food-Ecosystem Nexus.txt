This section explores key methodologies and tools that drive integrated actions for addressing interlinked 
SDG challenges. Methods offer structured procedures to achieve specific outcomes, while tools are the 
tangible resources facilitating method execution within an approach. A comprehensive overview of 
integrated mechanisms is provided to support Strategic Innovation. The Water-Food-Energy-Ecosystem 
Nexus, presented to exemplify the Nexus method, enhance a systemic analysis of specific SDGs 
interlinkages. Life Cycle Assessment provides a systemic perspective, accounting for socio-environmental 
impacts throughout initiatives' cycles. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis methods aid in strategic multi-
objective decision-making amid conflicting outcomes. Scenario Thinking visualizes outcomes from 
integrated strategies, while the Theory of Change operationalizes expected changes considering systemic 
interactions. These methodologies cover various aspects, from envisioning future scenarios to evaluating 
interventions and fostering ongoing learning and partnerships. The section also explores the landscape of 
opportunities within digital intelligence, leveraging Artificial Intelligence mechanisms and introducing key 
tools. 
 
2.2.1. The Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem Nexus  
The WEFE Nexus, integrating water, energy, food, and ecosystems, fosters sustainable development by 
acknowledging their global and local interdependence and their impact on quantity, quality, and access. 
This approach promotes integrated solutions aligned with sustainable development goals, emphasizing 
efficient resource use and stakeholder dialogue for policy coherence across sectors and governments. 
Employing a decision-making framework grounded in systems thinking, it identifies cross-sectorial 
impacts, explores trade-offs, and guides development pathways towards resource efficiency, equity, and 
sustainability at various governance levels. Its versatility spans the project cycle, aiding 
in planning, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Stakeholder 
dialogues, scenarios, and response options drive this approach, facilitating integrated 
Sustainable Energy Hub’s portfolio approach for UNDP Energy Moonshot:  
UNDP has established internal monitoring systems to track collective progress toward achieving the 
Energy Moonshot. The Tracker analysis aims to identify direct and indirect beneficiaries across all 
active UNDP energy projects aligned with the 2022-2025 Strategic Plan. Led by the Sustainable Energy 
Hub, efforts are underway to monitor and map the UNDP's portfolio of 320 energy-related projects. 
These projects encompass a diverse range, including on-grid and off-grid renewable electricity, solar 
home systems, clean cooking, and support for e-mobility. A devised methodology converts project 
outputs into quantifiable measures for direct and indirect beneficiaries. This initiative aims to monitor 
the UNDP's progress, provide global energy-related data to UNDP Country Offices and the organization 
as a whole, foster collaboration with partners for collective efforts, and integrate the Energy Moonshot 
with other initiatives for a cohesive approach. 
 
 
 
planning, decision-making, and cost-effective implementation. Methods range from qualitative indicators-
based approaches to operational systems, chosen based on data availability, scale of impacts, stakeholder 
involvement, and communication needs. This assessment process enhances understanding of sector 
interactions, leading to optimal solutions feeding into policy dialogues, contingent on contextual factors, 
capacities, and constructive dialogues. Advantages include its ability to address interconnected challenges, 
develop comprehensive policy responses, and create integrated policies and practices addressing 
crosscutting challenges for both immediate needs and long-term goals. This approach leverages co-
benefits, enhances resource productivity, resilience, and policy coherence, stimulating investments in 
sustainable infrastructure and ecosystem preservation (UNSGAB, 2014) (UNFCCC, 2015) (UNESCO, 2021) 
(SDG Asia Pacific, 2023) (UN et al., 2023) (Nexus, 2020).

Framework: JRC & UNESCO’s WEFE Nexus Framework 
In 2018, the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and UNESCO’s Intergovernmental 
Hydrological Programme (IHP) initiated the "Water–Energy–Food–Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus: 
Analyzing solutions for security supply" project amid water, energy, and food constraints.

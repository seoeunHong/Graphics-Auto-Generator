Energy is one of the main contributors to climate change, accounting for 73% of human-caused 
greenhouse gases. The developing world, particularly Africa with its carbon emissions accounting for less 
than three percent of global energy-related emissions, will bear the brunt of climate change impacts. 
Renewable energy use rose to 17.7 % in 2019, notably in electricity generation, hitting 26.2 %. Investment 
costs for small-scale renewable energy technologies (e.g., Solar Home Systems) dropped considerably in 
recent years, making these solutions competitive and signaling wider profitability ahead (ICSU, 2017). 
Some of the poorer regions of the world possess high-quality renewable resources (e.g. biomass and solar 
power in Africa), offering potential for poverty alleviation if leveraged effectively (ICSU, 2017). However, 
progress needs acceleration, especially in heating and transport sectors. Effective climate action demands 
bolstering policy support across all sectors and enhancing tools to mobilize private capital (UN-Habitat, 
2022). Increasing renewable energy adoption aligns with SDG 7.2 and interconnects with multiple goals, 
offering solutions to various global challenges while providing opportunities for health, jobs, and gender 
equality. They also mitigate climate change impact and improve cities and 
communitiesâ€™ resilience. However, renewable energy initiatives should place particular

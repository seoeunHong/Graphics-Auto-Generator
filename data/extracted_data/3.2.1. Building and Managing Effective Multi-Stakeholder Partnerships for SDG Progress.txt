This section delves into two essential strategies for fostering partnership and collaboration. Initially, it 
provides insights into constructing and efficiently managing multi-stakeholder partnerships aimed at 
addressing various SDGs. Following this, it examines methodological considerations for developing Joint 
Programs in a multi-stakeholder environment. UN leaders from UNDP, UNFPA, UNIDO, and UN Women 
have emphasized the imperative need for rapid scaling up of cross-sector partnerships to expedite 
progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (Accenture, 2018).  
 
3.2.1. Building and Managing Effective Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships for SDG Progress 
The 2030 Agenda Partnership Accelerator, led by UN DESA and The Partnering Initiative, in collaboration 
with UNOP, UN Global Compact, and UN Development Coordination Office, aims to expedite multi-
stakeholder partnerships for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It offers training, advisory 
services, and capacity building to member States, UN entities, and country teams to strengthen 
collaboration across sectors, foster new partnerships, and establish effective platforms at the national 
level. Its objectives include establishing partnerships, enhancing skills for SDG-focused collaborations, and 
promoting collaboration between diverse stakeholders to boost engagement and implementation of the 
SDGs. The Partnership Accelerator offers a network of individuals committed to building effective multi-
stakeholder partnerships for the Sustainable Development Goals (Accelerators) and a Partnership 
Learning Centre including modules on how to build and manage effective multi-stakeholder partnerships 
to advance the SDGs.  
Building and managing effective multi-stakeholder partnerships to advance the SDGs requires the 
following steps:  
• 
Creating Collaboration Space: Establish an environment conducive to collaboration, integrating 
policies, catalytic platforms, high partnership standards, institutionally adept 
organizations, and skilled individuals for fruitful partnerships. 
SDSN Climate & Energy Program: The purpose of the SDSN Climate & Energy Program is to bolster the 
capacity of UNFCCC signatory nations in formulating and executing long-term low greenhouse gas 
emissions strategies (NDCs and LEDSs) as stipulated by the Paris Agreement. It aims to develop 2050 
strategies for decarbonized energy systems through public-private collaborations, foster a global 
dialogue among engineers and tech experts for innovative carbon-neutral solutions, and facilitate 
international partnerships for technological solutions involving governments, businesses, academia, 
and civil society. This program seeks to empower nations in achieving the goals outlined in the Paris 
Agreement by enhancing technical capabilities, encouraging innovation, and promoting collaborative 
efforts across various sectors. 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
Partnerships for SDGs: Embrace the 2030 Agenda, emphasizing the need for significant changes 
in international development, fostering systematic collaboration among sectors, and elevating 
partnerships as pivotal for SDG-aligned progress. 
• 
Private Sector Engagement: Understand the private sector's role, incentives, potential conflicts of 
interest, and its alignment with development goals. 
• 
Defining Partnerships: Clarify the spectrum of partnerships for the SDGs, strategic planning, and 
categorization. 
• 
Understanding Stakeholders: Adopt a creative thinking approach in identifying stakeholders and 
resources. 
• 
Maximizing Partnership Value: Ensure every partnership generates net value for each partner 
through the Collaborative Advantage and maximize partnership value through negotiation. 
• 
Partnership Lifecycle: Understand the different stages of partnerships from initiation to 
conclusion. 
• 
Effective Partnership Building Blocks: Focus on fundamentals, partnership relationships, 
structuring, and management as the key building blocks for successful partnerships. 
• 
Institutional Readiness: Overcome internal obstacles within organizations, addressing strategic, 
systemic, capacity, and cultural challenges to amplify partnership ambitions.

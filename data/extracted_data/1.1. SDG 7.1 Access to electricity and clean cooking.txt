Despite significant progress in electricity access globally, challenges persist. The COVID-19 and 
complexities in reaching remote areas slowed progress, leaving 733 million without electricity and 2.8 
billion people relying on polluting fuels for cooking in 2020. The majority of these populations live in sub-
Saharan Africa, Asia, especially in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and rural areas. Economic strains due 
to the pandemic hindered access for up to 90 million. If trends continue, an estimated 670 million will lack 
electricity by 2030, with one-fourth of the world's population still lacking clean cooking. Addressing this 
gap requires a major push to assist those living in the least developed areas and in fragile and conflict-
affected countries. The goal of ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy 
services, such as electricity and clean cooking mechanisms, is framed within SDG 7.1. Its 
interconnectedness with various goals (Figure 1) offers synergies to address multiple global challenges, 
amplifying opportunities for education, health, food security and economic development. However, this 
goal necessitates balancing energy sufficiency and affordability, ensuring effective battery management, 
while guaranteeing inclusiveness and gender-responsiveness. The subsequent sections provide a concise 
explanation of these synergies and trade-offs, supported by relevant case studies.

2.2.3. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis frameworks  
Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) is a decision-making framework that evaluates alternatives influenced by 
diverse, conflicting factors. It integrates different metrics, particularly helpful for non-monetary impacts, 
aiding evaluations amidst conflicting objectives. Through individual criteria, it provides overall 
performance indicators for alternatives, allowing comparative assessments. By ranking options based on 
established criteria, MCA guides project evaluation and decision-making phases, offering insights into 
trade-offs among alternatives. Its strengths lie in enabling non-monetary impact comparison and 
systematically evaluating conflicting factors to identify stable solutions in complex decision problems (WB, 
2023) (IAEA) 
 
2.2.4. Scenario Thinking:  
Scenario Thinking is a qualitative method visualizing plausible futures, providing narratives about potential 
developments in a specific region or issue. It's designed to explore diverse future possibilities amidst 
uncertainty and engages stakeholders in envisioning sustainable development pathways. This approach 
addresses complexity, encourages stakeholder collaboration, supports quantitative analysis, and creates 
compelling narratives about achieving sustainable development goals. Utilizing participatory exercises, it 
generates qualitative storylines, engages stakeholders, integrates sustainable 
development dimensions, and identifies short-/medium-/long-term effects of

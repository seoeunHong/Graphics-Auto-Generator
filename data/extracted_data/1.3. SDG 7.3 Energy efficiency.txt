abuses, including threats, land grabs and harm to indigenous communities, highlight the need for 
establishing clear policies to protect human rights, involving stakeholders, and providing accessible 
redress mechanisms in renewable energy projects (OHCHR, 2016) (CCSI, 2023). For instance, the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights outline steps companies must take to respect human 
rights and provide remedies for harms their operations cause or contribute to (Amnesty, 2023). A socio-
economic footprint analysis of the energy transition performed by IRENA in South Africa and Egypt, 
enhance the comprehensive assessment of renewable energy potential impacts on environment, people 
and livelihoods protection and jobs creation (Box 13).

Box 13: IRENA's assessment of the energy transition's socio-economic impact in South Africa and 
Egypt builds on its World Energy Transitions Outlook. This effort aims to support transition planning 
and informed policymaking. The South African report showcases a wind project and the establishment 
of a Small-Medium Enterprise focused on bird monitoring. This project enhanced positive socio-
economic impacts on local communities by creating new professional opportunities for disadvantaged 
community members and fostering bird protection mechanisms.

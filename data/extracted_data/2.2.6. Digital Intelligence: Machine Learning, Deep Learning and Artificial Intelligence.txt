development, aiding stakeholders in envisioning multiple futures and addressing complex problems, 
fostering collaboration, supporting quantitative analysis, and offering engaging narratives about 
sustainable societies (UNESCAP, 2015) (SDGs UN, 2016). 
 
2.2.5. Theory of Change  
A Theory of Change method explains how interventions drive specific development changes based on 
causal analysis and evidence. It clarifies pathways from outputs to outcomes, aiding in planning and 
evaluating initiatives. This approach tackles complex problems, supports learning cycles, fosters 
partnerships, and acts as a concise communication tool. By outlining causal pathways, identifying needs 
and assumptions, and engaging partners, it helps understand and address underlying challenges. When 
applied to SDGs, it helps in understanding the interconnections between actions and impacts, aiding in 
the planning and evaluation of initiatives. The Theory of Change methodology involves a consultative and 
evidence-based approach, focusing on continuous learning and improvement while ensuring clarity and 
quality in program design and implementation. This method guides program design and fosters continuous 
learning and partnership development (UNEP, 2023)(UNICEF)(UNSDG).

Case Study: Accès aux services énergétiques, Niger, UNDP 
Tool: Energy Moonshot AI Data Platform (UNDP) 
To bring clean energy to 500 million more people by 2025 and drive the shift to renewables, a fresh 
approach is vital. The Energy Moonshot AI Data Platform is breaking new ground, combining AI and 
geospatial data to offer unparalleled insights for energy projects worldwide. This tool empowers local 
action, tapping into global innovation. Refined by using cutting-edge technology, like Large Language 
Models, it supports technical officers and development efforts by providing energy insights. 
Automation features optimize project monitoring and reporting, offering live beneficiary updates. 
Through collaboration, this platform aims to seamlessly integrate AI advancements into energy policy 
and planning.
